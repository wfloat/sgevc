000267|Chapter 11 On the Doorstep
000039|Our thanks to God's oath.
000289|No, said Piggy carelessly.
000343|And what does it mean?
000290|There goes the shawl again.
000243|And has you slain him?
000175|All this we have won by our labor.
000159|Such tunes are a joy to dance in, Faye.
000141|Can I lodge here tonight?
000229|The first year they sowed wrath.
000322|A special pot, too.
000272|No admittance except on party business.
000214|But what about this thing? Sticky.
000258|Mom shuts one's mouth up, doesn't it?
000278|I know you.
000308|Perhaps you think that is a queer title for this chapter.
000065|Tom could hardly speak for laughing.
000086|and tick attack 2.
000089|Let go of my top knot
000174|I pay half a crown a week extra.
000307|I owe them 500 dollars.
000007|I'm as bad as I can be.
000179|Daisy creams with pink edges.
000239|This is the way that snakes always talk.
000142|Wake now my Mary tats
000280|Your path now goes south.
000265|I've just shot a stag.
000074|Come on my jack-in-the-boxes.
000227|Born once every hundred years, dies in flames.
000224|Do you know the lid opens?
000332|Where are you going?
000269|But show me how your map.
000274|because he was a man with infinite resource and seg-city.
000081|And I never had a whooping cough. Why?
000006|Andy, what's that guy into the gimbal?
000067|I suppose no, it doesn't.
000128|Put that rude grasshopper in jail.
000339|And be with you, Tom.
000236|How rash are you are?
000137|Let this glass globe be.
000312|father has yellow eyes
000250|her kind and firm glance
000206|Still, you owe it a duty.
000046|They'd never know I'd regular run away.
000350|Do you have anything in mind?
000170|But if you hadn't done them.
000313|Give me a fine fat goose.
000282|Alice, I won't forget it again.
000182|Age 45 if a day of life.
000260|As soon as she went in, there was disorder.
000264|slam the doors and wedge them.
000100|Well, anyhow, it didn't rain, he said.
000020|At the roots of a bush of a grass.
000196|Clear out your eyes and bright your breath.
000263|She said in subdued voice,
000320|Go Billy asked the old Chinese guy.
000112|Clown to call him Joey.
000246|We cannot do it, sir.
000279|These words behind the ears is nonsense.
000101|It's me, Piglet. Help, help!
000242|Give me your hand or I will cry harder than before.
000304|How do you like you, Dirty Bird?
000114|1‚ÅÑ2 pounds of flour and 2 ounces of sweet.
000115|He might call it, for example,
000198|I'd shoot myself.
000021|As rich as Peter's son-in-law.
000116|No, I burst the balloon.
000098|said the witch.
000131|It must come sometimes to jam a day.
000187|An hour out of Guilford Town.
000051|said the American to the Chinese.
000024|The football teams give a tea party.
000099|I've hit the wrong nose.
000054|Are you a regular darky, really?
000121|Finn and the Fairy Shoemaker
000083|Be off now as quick as you may.
000057|Hannibal come to see you.
000212|No, thank you.
000288|She has felt shy of it.
000244|Off for the prison ship.
000219|But the tune isn't his own invention.
000208|However, somebody killed something.
000085|Suppose I take my grandmother a fresh vegetable.
000275|You shouldn't have pricked him with your horn.
000226|and the next day nurse will be released.
000286|One, two, three, where is your breakfast?
000092|Does the one that wins get the crown?
000305|The fisherman and his wife see George every day.
000201|A lady is on Alice's lap.
000066|Shall we let Barbara in?
000096|I don't paint a tiger.
000234|Hurry up, hurry up.
000178|and vowed he'd change the pigtail's place.
000035|The name really is the aged, aged man.
000140|What an impetuous boy he is.
000022|And what are doves? And what are doves?
000052|from August 18th of their divorce.
000058|The octopus has eight legs.
000324|and she caught at the brooch.
000192|I've had to grow old.
000345|A whirring noise was heard.
000163|how they went to the mountains to eat nuts.
000090|And they did push so.
000014|Annie, please. Please don't hurt me.
000281|He could not help doing so
000026|Let's make the noise like a snake.
000053|He was still in the forest.
000168|I said you look like an egg, sir.
000060|That I am a born nurse.
000017|Why has this egg not broken?
000075|I'd far rather go without them than eat them.
000340|So Tom saw night as it were broad daylight.
000108|The squire himself showed perfect.
000210|It weighs 7.5 kilogram.
000202|Yeah, that sounds good.
000056|Your midget wife can never sing a song.
000123|I am from Towel Land.
000251|The ladybug told them proudly.
000266|We may join with that power.
000347|What are you waiting for, man?
000283|They had been named Tom and Jerry.
000205|Fear neither root nor sprout.
000138|but one requires the explorer to furnish proofs.
000207|What am I? I'm a racer, son of God.
000005|Clear then clear water.
000071|She was born on April 1943.
000306|Please invite Tom if there is not requires.
000049|Then we all say, aha!
000036|How I hate this foul pool.
000126|Well, this turn goes to the hill.
000135|I blinked my eyes hard.
000277|The end part is fish mouth.
000248|in which Piglet meets an elephant.
000249|You may imagine how I gape.
000009|on the 22nd of last March.
000154|He dreamt them all night.
000030|Must the name mean something?
000034|A divine wrath made her blue eyes awful.
000240|Both side was softly curved.
000315|It's to say how you do with Tom's answer.
000003|That I owe my thanks to you.
000169|Sam waved his arm vaguely.
000077|But I saw you walking.
000183|Fresh pain seized Paul's body.
000073|How suspicious this fox.
000018|then sadly it is much farther.
000330|She keeps saying I'm hers.
000238|Today isn't another day.
000293|He is old-fashioned, but he is the best of men.
000285|The straw, charcoal, and the pea.
000155|This speech roused Dame Iles to anger.
000215|He likes dragons very much.
000195|A boat put out on the bay.
000106|I guess it's a choice feast.
000317|At length they came to a sharp end.
000262|I believe you are one of them.
000341|Enough, you foolish chatter.
000186|She jumped at the tail and bit it savagely.
000125|to catch that bulrush root with my paw.
000190|and they were sandy yellow brownish all over.
000029|Rat came and replied on leaves.
000166|They ate beef at the butcher shop.
000167|I toy with my liquor.
000268|He showed no signs of age.
000150|I hope you enjoy yourself.
000048|You are not a runaway. Who are you?
000144|We all see Panda on TV or in the zoo.
000156|The eye could not catch them.
000199|Captain Tom receives an angry letter.
000146|He said to Jack, the chatterer,
000295|I know how to obey orders.
000095|What I have we here?
000143|Pussy can sit by the fire and sing.
000233|Why should I care, though? David's lips were twitching.
000193|Please hire me after you.
000329|and his heart wagged with joy like a lamb's tail.
000037|I think it'll encourage me.
000327|It's part of my secret.
000276|Can your name be more hilarious?
000335|But things haven't changed yet.
000031|All smile were real, and the happier, the more sincere.
000188|Now quicker the fiddle went.
000326|They are made of wood.
000040|in which Fox loses a tail and its elder sister finds one.
000044|Take courage. All isn't lost yet.
000191|I make her quite nervy at times.
000309|He owed, Mr. Lawson. I can't tell you how.
000254|She laughed.
000252|I am run off my feet.
000185|The newborn baby is stolen as we go.
000217|Your cruelty shall cost your laugh.
000136|She has eaten the tapioca, all of it.
000033|This used to be Jerry's occupation.
000241|We have showed his shark tooth.
000028|She had said so that one could keep up a conversation.
000225|Her existence makes him pleasant.
000197|Fur flew through the air, teeth gnashed.
000323|Why did I wake up?
000342|Why should I purchase my own?
000331|She'll be feverish after so much thinking.
000296|You woke me up.
000012|Her shoes were like fishes.
000001|The nine, the eggs, I keep.
000122|Am I an absolute pauper?
000291|The end of February 14th.
000300|Six was halfway down the room.
000025|She is now choosing a skirt to wear.
000253|I have a soothsayer.
000050|Rabbit gave Dog a hurrying up sort of nudge.
000184|We have been fine, haven't we?
000237|What would they do at the end of the year?
000216|Well, it isn't picked at all.
000013|I have bum-breed all over Goat on two separate occasions.
000209|A raging fire was in his eyes.
000221|I am a selfish sinner.
000019|At the end of four,
000270|Chew leaves quickly, said Rabbit.
000235|If not, I shall go no further.
000027|Monster made a deep bow.
000064|And we are so thirsty.
000245|Do you think it's a woozle?
000222|Ask God to help you.
000203|Yes, I was not grabbed.
000120|Our King George is laborers.
000157|Blackbird and Jay.
000189|when such wanderers meet.
000104|Here I am whom you seek.
000010|A nauseous draft.
000255|This was the 25th of November, 1783.
000094|They found a cow grazing in the field.
000118|Look out, said Alice.
000344|Lucy, a clever farmer.
000107|Tom and Michael woke up next morning.
000200|That cloth does not look worth much.
000055|A deafening chirping rent the air.
000271|I say I will be emperor.
000346|I am going to back home.
000151|All the way to Chana's home.
000171|I say neither yea nor nay.
000164|His large mouth curled into a sneer.
000181|First, issue a reward.
000011|Chapter 10, A Warm Welcome
000316|A thief in the night.
000165|They were going fast with a light clip.
000130|and would spoil my joke.
000111|We not le dance our heyday guys.
000059|043 a silver shilling is journey
000068|I do not eat bread.
000078|You aren't quite safe with me.
000230|Your own wife is not at home.
000070|Tom now let our arrows fly.
000177|Tom fell with a cloven head.
000232|We'll call her Lily, for short.
000298|She came back to the valley.
000348|Dear customer, welcome to our ship.
000041|I choose the right way.
000117|They were children of mad.
000160|Kitty, can you play chess?
000256|I must have two to fetch and carry.
000091|We expected Tom would jump for joy.
000093|to buy two pork chops.
000314|Bob goes to a new school.
000032|Who has been repeating all that hard stuff to you?
000047|Please excuse me.
000319|How could I dig burrows with short toenails?
000109|if they mother knew it.
000310|Why, it is just like a round egg which sounds thin.
000133|I can smell the breath of an English.
000153|But we are not high yet.
000063|Asteroid 325
000004|They went up to the dark mess Job had pointed out.
000102|This is Jack, the relative of Tom.
000349|What do you think of this question?
000082|A fair jaw cracker dwarf language must be.
000088|In my opinion, that is a good idea.
000333|You gain for nothing, girl.
000149|My Winding Sheet.
000220|Her paw went into your eye?
000043|Story 29, A Boy and a Monkey
000045|The nastiest things they saw were the cobwebs.
000152|Guilty for what do you rule?
000132|My God, I thank you for this mercy.
000223|Pick, pick, pick.
000292|She has a high voice.
000172|I shall say goodbye.
000302|501 million, right?
000338|Paul's teeth ached because of lemon.
000334|Another one, 10,000 dollars.
000301|I'm sure your friends can't wait.
000294|Now I understand.
000337|But, Mom, I'm not certain about it.
000284|Chapter 18 The Return Journey
000228|It says no way! shouted Daisy.
000213|Let it give us a chance, my precious.
000257|I would scoff at these followers.
000069|Not much use, is it, Sam?
000097|Confess that you opened the thirteenth door.
000080|Then there was a report.
000231|He told me that I ought to change.
000087|A hippo lives in the zoo.
000113|Mr. Lawson saw George last night.
000015|Poor Tom. Now is dead.
000261|After a while, he perceived both giants.
000328|It would be a hard choice.
000162|I lent George three pounds.
000321|called out the cloud.
000259|The song is called Ways and Means.
000161|That's a full-grown cult.
000038|Hold up my chin, slow and solid.
000336|Over them swooped the eagles.
000008|That was his chief thought.
000158|It looks much better.
000303|I am loath to see him go.
000147|and there you'll find a Snapdragon fly.
000016|Mr. Sherman, I move for a division.
000325|She has no place for a hot pepper.
000127|Cause I know I had some honey.
000297|How Tom and Jerry went to visit Mr. Sam.
000173|He searched through the box.
000311|I am back safe again.
000218|I'll send for Tom to my boudoir.
000273|I'd just as soon swim your way as others do.
000103|The elephant and the carpenter is the longest.
000287|A voice said, Come in.
000318|The name of the song is called Haddocks.
000079|All my gum tips gone as well.
000105|He was killed by an arrow.
000129|A large flat ferry boat was moored beside it.
000180|Toast from the breadfruit tree.
000072|How are you, dear child?
000061|Mid-year is day, Shire year.
000124|You know, answer to the name of Tom's son?
000148|And on the top of them came Winnie the cute bear.
000211|From each cake there sprang a huge dog.
000002|I did go and made many prisoners.
000110|Act Drop Second Act Scene
000119|The owl flew into a bush.
000062|Tom went on Eeyore gloomily.
000299|His hope will cheat him.
000176|She just smiled calmly. Mother knows that it is best to smile.
000084|by hook or by crook.
000076|The hag looked in the stove.
000247|She and I are running a neck-and-neck race.
000145|Read by the Living Pool.
000134|Rare Rabbit had a little apron.
000023|I thought you meant how old are you.
000139|Cuckoos is downheaded and crying.
000204|The song is really loud and on the gate.
000042|She may mind you of her.
000194|Yes, I miss her.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000641.wav|0|100000|Do you need ammo, guns?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000642.wav|0|100000|Why are you still here?

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000652.wav|0|100000|Yeah. I'm glad you weren't.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000653.wav|0|100000|My wedding can suck it?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000654.wav|0|100000|This isn't the real list.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000655.wav|0|100000|I'm too fast for TV.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000656.wav|0|100000|I got these shoes here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000657.wav|0|100000|The Tysons are here waiting.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000659.wav|0|100000|Give him a fucking mustache.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000660.wav|0|100000|That's enough of that horseshit.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000661.wav|0|100000|- He gave me the explosives.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000662.wav|0|100000|You're really good at that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000663.wav|0|100000|What time is that, exactly?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000674.wav|0|100000|I asked her if she would check Alan's cellphone for any recently made calls.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000675.wav|0|100000|I'm real glad we have six months together before you have to go to...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000676.wav|0|100000|What difference does it make if my wife was in on it or not?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000677.wav|0|100000|I just want to say I'm-I'm so honored that you're-you're doing this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000679.wav|0|100000|I am falling for you, Caroline, and I'm pretty sure you feel the same.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000680.wav|0|100000|What it meant to you Was still another chance to move closer to blake.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000681.wav|0|100000|Let's go to a pet shop tomorrow and get a new cat, all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000682.wav|0|100000|You insisted that you would not be left at Casterly Rock under any circumstances.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000683.wav|0|100000|I'm really hoping that you and I can move forward with my book, Julianne.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000684.wav|0|100000|You will call an outsider in the middle of the night and tell him...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000685.wav|0|100000|I know you think you're saving your people, but you need to stop this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000686.wav|0|100000|You probably aren't the sort of person who is cut out for manipulating others.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000687.wav|0|100000|The guy hanging naked from the shower curtain rod... half dead from autoerotic asphyxiation?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000688.wav|0|100000|Well, just don't use no sticks or no knives or no piece of iron.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000689.wav|0|100000|Because now he'll have to stay with these people for a long, long time.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000690.wav|0|100000|An impairment of set-background discrimination can get you into a heap of trouble.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000691.wav|0|100000|It made you write a book about the seven steps to heal the heart?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000692.wav|0|100000|I heard that Ibaragi Doji who lives in Senjo-ga-take is a demon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000693.wav|0|100000|I cannot imagine what they will do if the cache is not returned whole.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000694.wav|0|100000|We would love to save your princess, but are looking for two royal geeks.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000695.wav|0|100000|If you came to say more cruel things to me, I'm going to bed.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000714.wav|0|100000|Easy on the gin, heavy on the tonic.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000715.wav|0|100000|I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000716.wav|0|100000|Peter Jennings and Tom Brokaw have bald spots!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000717.wav|0|100000|I'm not gonna inquire about that right now.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000718.wav|0|100000|I'm only a messenger, that must be obvious.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000719.wav|0|100000|But I never stopped to think about it
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000720.wav|0|100000|Did you see the eyes on that thing?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000721.wav|0|100000|And when I look back from a distance,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000722.wav|0|100000|You have nothing to return to in Stockholm.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000723.wav|0|100000|Look, I just need a few more minutes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000724.wav|0|100000|- Don, I can't seem to access this site.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000725.wav|0|100000|Don't you think his stomach is really big?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000726.wav|0|100000|What did you want them to be, wrong?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000727.wav|0|100000|Uh, I can't believe how fat I look.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000728.wav|0|100000|I bought it at piggly wiggly for 95 cents.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000729.wav|0|100000|When they rob you, you don't take money.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000730.wav|0|100000|They killed my boy and just drove on...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000731.wav|0|100000|Are you or are you not the Messiah?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000732.wav|0|100000|It was Eva Marie Saint and Sal Mineo.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000733.wav|0|100000|So let me put this simply for you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000734.wav|0|100000|- This medicine doesn't do a bit of good.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000735.wav|0|100000|Does everyone in your business talk like that?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000736.wav|0|100000|- Leave him alone!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000737.wav|0|100000|Small fucking towns.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000739.wav|0|100000|Sorry about that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000740.wav|0|100000|- Uh, this morning.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000741.wav|0|100000|- We'll get you.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000744.wav|0|100000|Not this time.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000745.wav|0|100000|Yet firm too.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000746.wav|0|100000|Great distraction, man!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000748.wav|0|100000|I say we slip the message into one of the dog's collars, round up some fleas, put them on the dog.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000752.wav|0|100000|We got to stick together, until we know how to play him or until he slips up, then we get him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000757.wav|0|100000|If you wanna help the public and do your jobs best, sit quietly and listen to what I have to say.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000761.wav|0|100000|We just wanted to get married quietly, without any hoo-ha.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000762.wav|0|100000|Even if I don't know exactly what it is I do.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000763.wav|0|100000|Trouble is, Ann, when I'm standin' up my mind's lyin' down.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000764.wav|0|100000|Damn, if that don't feel like I got my balls back.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000765.wav|0|100000|All I know is that there is evil in the air..
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000766.wav|0|100000|And sooner or later we're gonna find where the money is.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000769.wav|0|100000|Well, my friend, all is not well on the hippie front.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000770.wav|0|100000|She's probably in black velvet with a feather in her hair.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000771.wav|0|100000|Tonight, I prefer to just dine in the shadows, thank you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000772.wav|0|100000|Sometimes the enemy of my enemy is my friend, Agent Gibbs.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000773.wav|0|100000|For not turning you back over to the marshals to hang.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000774.wav|0|100000|Just for what Master Wang has said, we are all Chinese.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000775.wav|0|100000|Um, can you call me back when you get this, please?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000776.wav|0|100000|So, is he the man of your life, or what happened?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000777.wav|0|100000|When white people see me coming into their store, they run.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000804.wav|0|100000|Just when we need him most.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000805.wav|0|100000|You look like you've been crying.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000806.wav|0|100000|Oh, just a spare power cell.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000814.wav|0|100000|I am not making an accusation.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000829.wav|0|100000|He's a man, who kills when he wants to, if I want to, no power on earth can stop me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000853.wav|0|100000|No, it--it--it sounds weird, but it was totally a spur-of-the-moment thing,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000855.wav|0|100000|No, it's just, uh, she caught me at Dad's yesterday, and she really laid into me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000856.wav|0|100000|Very much what everyone...first thing that comes into their mind when they think about me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000857.wav|0|100000|I just spent more and more time at the diner, trying to make the place work.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000858.wav|0|100000|You know, you should check into Mr. Hennessey and see what he was doing last night.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000859.wav|0|100000|I think he hid it in the mineshaft, which is about a half a mile north.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000860.wav|0|100000|Do you know that for a fact, or is that just what you want to believe?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000861.wav|0|100000|Look, Chuck is my boyfriend, and he makes $12 an hour, so you stay away from him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000862.wav|0|100000|Because they definitely want me back, and I wanna be able to have the freedom to...

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000963.wav|0|2|I just wanted you to loosen up, have a good time - lt's okay.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000964.wav|0|2|I'm just going to agitate some of your molecules and split them apart.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000965.wav|0|2|None of this would have been possible if you hadn't trusted the Cylon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000966.wav|0|100000|- Fine, once I got 'em six bags of chips and some fresh air.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000967.wav|0|100000|It's sort of the Dukes of Hazzard method of avoiding the cops, so...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000968.wav|0|100000|Because you were talking with Vincent's wife.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000969.wav|0|100000|Do you wanna punish me right now?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000970.wav|0|100000|What are you playing at this time?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000971.wav|0|100000|Forget all this is out here sometimes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000972.wav|0|100000|What did you say your name was?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000973.wav|0|100000|But really, I admire you very much.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000975.wav|0|100000|- I expect you to tell the truth.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000976.wav|0|100000|And what is your period, Mr. Smart?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_000977.wav|0|100000|Take the room next to hers, Sonja.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001563.wav|0|100000|What time is that, exactly?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001574.wav|0|100000|I asked her if she would check Alan's cellphone for any recently made calls.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001575.wav|0|100000|I'm real glad we have six months together before you have to go to...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001576.wav|0|100000|What difference does it make if my wife was in on it or not?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001577.wav|0|100000|I just want to say I'm-I'm so honored that you're-you're doing this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001579.wav|0|100000|I am falling for you, Caroline, and I'm pretty sure you feel the same.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001580.wav|0|100000|What it meant to you Was still another chance to move closer to blake.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001581.wav|0|100000|Let's go to a pet shop tomorrow and get a new cat, all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001582.wav|0|100000|You insisted that you would not be left at Casterly Rock under any circumstances.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001583.wav|0|100000|I'm really hoping that you and I can move forward with my book, Julianne.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001584.wav|0|100000|You will call an outsider in the middle of the night and tell him...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001585.wav|0|100000|I know you think you're saving your people, but you need to stop this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001586.wav|0|100000|You probably aren't the sort of person who is cut out for manipulating others.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001587.wav|0|100000|The guy hanging naked from the shower curtain rod... half dead from autoerotic asphyxiation?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001588.wav|0|100000|Well, just don't use no sticks or no knives or no piece of iron.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001589.wav|0|100000|Because now he'll have to stay with these people for a long, long time.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001590.wav|0|100000|An impairment of set-background discrimination can get you into a heap of trouble.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001591.wav|0|100000|It made you write a book about the seven steps to heal the heart?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001592.wav|0|100000|I heard that Ibaragi Doji who lives in Senjo-ga-take is a demon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001593.wav|0|100000|I cannot imagine what they will do if the cache is not returned whole.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001617.wav|0|100000|I'm not gonna inquire about that right now.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001618.wav|0|100000|I'm only a messenger, that must be obvious.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001619.wav|0|100000|But I never stopped to think about it
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001620.wav|0|100000|Did you see the eyes on that thing?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001621.wav|0|100000|And when I look back from a distance,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001622.wav|0|100000|You have nothing to return to in Stockholm.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001623.wav|0|100000|Look, I just need a few more minutes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001624.wav|0|100000|- Don, I can't seem to access this site.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001626.wav|0|100000|What did you want them to be, wrong?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001627.wav|0|100000|Uh, I can't believe how fat I look.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001628.wav|0|100000|I bought it at piggly wiggly for 95 cents.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001629.wav|0|100000|When they rob you, you don't take money.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001630.wav|0|100000|They killed my boy and just drove on...

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001632.wav|0|100000|It was Eva Marie Saint and Sal Mineo.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001633.wav|0|100000|So let me put this simply for you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001634.wav|0|100000|- This medicine doesn't do a bit of good.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001635.wav|0|100000|Does everyone in your business talk like that?

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001639.wav|0|100000|Sorry about that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001640.wav|0|100000|- Uh, this morning.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001641.wav|0|100000|- We'll get you.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001644.wav|0|100000|Not this time.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001645.wav|0|100000|Yet firm too.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001646.wav|0|100000|Great distraction, man!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001648.wav|0|100000|I say we slip the message into one of the dog's collars, round up some fleas, put them on the dog.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001652.wav|0|100000|We got to stick together, until we know how to play him or until he slips up, then we get him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001657.wav|0|100000|If you wanna help the public and do your jobs best, sit quietly and listen to what I have to say.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001661.wav|0|100000|We just wanted to get married quietly, without any hoo-ha.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001662.wav|0|100000|Even if I don't know exactly what it is I do.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001663.wav|0|100000|Trouble is, Ann, when I'm standin' up my mind's lyin' down.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001664.wav|0|100000|Damn, if that don't feel like I got my balls back.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001665.wav|0|100000|All I know is that there is evil in the air..
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001666.wav|0|100000|And sooner or later we're gonna find where the money is.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001667.wav|0|100000|Mrs. Faber confessed to stabbing Rocco with her husband's knife once.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001669.wav|0|100000|Well, my friend, all is not well on the hippie front.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001670.wav|0|100000|She's probably in black velvet with a feather in her hair.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001671.wav|0|100000|Tonight, I prefer to just dine in the shadows, thank you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001672.wav|0|100000|Sometimes the enemy of my enemy is my friend, Agent Gibbs.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001673.wav|0|100000|For not turning you back over to the marshals to hang.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001674.wav|0|100000|Just for what Master Wang has said, we are all Chinese.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001675.wav|0|100000|Um, can you call me back when you get this, please?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001676.wav|0|100000|So, is he the man of your life, or what happened?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001677.wav|0|100000|When white people see me coming into their store, they run.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001702.wav|0|100000|Venus cannot be her real name.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001703.wav|0|100000|- It was Teru Mikami's own decision...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001704.wav|0|100000|Just when we need him most.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001705.wav|0|100000|You look like you've been crying.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001706.wav|0|100000|Oh, just a spare power cell.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001707.wav|0|100000|You don't want to marry him?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001708.wav|0|100000|Bobby, you're to remember this number.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001709.wav|0|100000|No one has to die here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001710.wav|0|100000|I have an audition on Friday.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001711.wav|0|100000|# You workin' that, you trickin' that

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001713.wav|0|100000|He was only good in crafts!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001714.wav|0|100000|I am not making an accusation.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001729.wav|0|100000|He's a man, who kills when he wants to, if I want to, no power on earth can stop me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001753.wav|0|100000|No, it--it--it sounds weird, but it was totally a spur-of-the-moment thing,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001755.wav|0|100000|No, it's just, uh, she caught me at Dad's yesterday, and she really laid into me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001756.wav|0|100000|Very much what everyone...first thing that comes into their mind when they think about me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001757.wav|0|100000|I just spent more and more time at the diner, trying to make the place work.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001758.wav|0|100000|You know, you should check into Mr. Hennessey and see what he was doing last night.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001759.wav|0|100000|I think he hid it in the mineshaft, which is about a half a mile north.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001760.wav|0|100000|Do you know that for a fact, or is that just what you want to believe?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001761.wav|0|100000|Look, Chuck is my boyfriend, and he makes $12 an hour, so you stay away from him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001762.wav|0|100000|Because they definitely want me back, and I wanna be able to have the freedom to...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001763.wav|0|100000|We'll do a second line of resistance up there, on the hill, two hundred meters away.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001768.wav|0|100000|You can believe that!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001769.wav|0|100000|I'm looking for Pboo.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001772.wav|0|100000|Guys, my back hurts.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001773.wav|0|100000|What is going on?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001774.wav|0|100000|Garza's alibi checks out!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001775.wav|0|100000|No baby, come here.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001779.wav|0|100000|And then I'm frightened.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001863.wav|0|4|I just wanted you to loosen up, have a good time - lt's okay.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001864.wav|0|4|I'm just going to agitate some of your molecules and split them apart.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001865.wav|0|4|None of this would have been possible if you hadn't trusted the Cylon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001866.wav|0|100000|- Fine, once I got 'em six bags of chips and some fresh air.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001867.wav|0|100000|It's sort of the Dukes of Hazzard method of avoiding the cops, so...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001868.wav|0|100000|Because you were talking with Vincent's wife.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001869.wav|0|100000|Do you wanna punish me right now?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001870.wav|0|100000|What are you playing at this time?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001871.wav|0|100000|Forget all this is out here sometimes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001872.wav|0|100000|What did you say your name was?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001873.wav|0|100000|But really, I admire you very much.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001874.wav|0|100000|You made my sister spit at me
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001875.wav|0|100000|- I expect you to tell the truth.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001876.wav|0|100000|And what is your period, Mr. Smart?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001877.wav|0|100000|Take the room next to hers, Sonja.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001878.wav|0|100000|I've had enough excitement for one life.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001879.wav|0|100000|And poor Mary, she was so scared.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001880.wav|0|100000|- Did you use that as bait so--
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001881.wav|0|100000|I know what dengue fever is like.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001882.wav|0|100000|But break it gently she is old ...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001883.wav|0|100000|We don't make anything off that one.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001884.wav|0|100000|- some manner of harm many moons ago.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001901.wav|0|100000|What they do... is they will sit up in this higher energy state... and then drop down again.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001902.wav|0|100000|I slept with Jacob once when I had to go to his house to pick up my dogs.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001903.wav|0|100000|You know, I've been thinking, when you blew up your car back there, you blew up mine, too.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001905.wav|0|100000|I'm just going to go and talk to Daddy for a few minutes... and I'll be right back.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001907.wav|0|100000|I also built that library and used it to help a dozen guys get a high school diploma.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001908.wav|0|100000|No, that is an example of map... I've seen maps, certainly, that have my road on, for example.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001909.wav|0|100000|There are contractors that show up in pickup trucks, and they kind of watch you and surveil you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001922.wav|0|100000|Rest those little bones, while I go out and make a goddamn fool of myself.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001925.wav|0|100000|What is the reason you were in the desert so close to the Mexican border?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001926.wav|0|100000|Why does everyone feel the need to have these things, these, like, symbols of adulthood?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001927.wav|0|100000|We were supposed to go to Opera House in it and conduct a big raid.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001928.wav|0|100000|I've been keeping it a secret for months, and I'm going to stop hiding it.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001929.wav|0|100000|At the end of the month, I get a bonus, 10% of anything the horses make.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0000_001930.wav|0|100000|The other two were floating in the hotel pool, and they weren't doing the backstroke.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_000965.wav|1|2|None of this would have been possible if you hadn't trusted the Cylon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_000966.wav|1|100000|- Fine, once I got 'em six bags of chips and some fresh air.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_000967.wav|1|100000|It's sort of the Dukes of Hazzard method of avoiding the cops, so...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_000968.wav|1|100000|Because you were talking with Vincent's wife.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_000969.wav|1|100000|Do you wanna punish me right now?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_000970.wav|1|100000|What are you playing at this time?

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_000975.wav|1|100000|- I expect you to tell the truth.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_000976.wav|1|100000|And what is your period, Mr. Smart?

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_000981.wav|1|100000|I know what dengue fever is like.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_000982.wav|1|100000|But break it gently she is old ...

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001060.wav|1|100000|What if Joan and Arthur cave to State and send her home?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001061.wav|1|100000|I think she wants me to rub olive oil on your taint.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001062.wav|1|100000|They were yelling at him, "Mr President, we need you to act!"
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001063.wav|1|100000|Yeah, in the 1920s a cat burglar named Nigel Hubbard left no fingerprints.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001064.wav|1|100000|- My father's had that book in a drawer since I was born.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001066.wav|1|100000|I've always been a rational man with a great faith in science.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001067.wav|1|100000|If I had a big hollywood guy like you on my team,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001068.wav|1|100000|I don't think her boyfriend was too happy about her moving out.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001069.wav|1|100000|But this incident has helped me gain a new respect for him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001070.wav|1|100000|Why did you come with a pistol and point it at Tony?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001071.wav|1|100000|I realized I knew Herbert Gelman only after I'd heard his testimony.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001072.wav|1|100000|Meaningless words... you say, as you exhale to slow down the breath.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001073.wav|1|100000|L'm here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001074.wav|1|100000|But, but...

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001094.wav|1|100000|- First, our hosts attacked us.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001095.wav|1|100000|Your hair is so pretty.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001096.wav|1|100000|Shall we arrange this way
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001097.wav|1|100000|Don't lie to me, Logan.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001098.wav|1|100000|I won't show any mercy!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001099.wav|1|100000|- Not a sound all night.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001100.wav|1|100000|And you will be crushed.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001101.wav|1|100000|I've been walking for miles.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001102.wav|1|100000|Yeah. I'm glad you weren't.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001103.wav|1|100000|My wedding can suck it?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001104.wav|1|100000|This isn't the real list.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001105.wav|1|100000|I'm too fast for TV.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001106.wav|1|100000|I got these shoes here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001107.wav|1|100000|The Tysons are here waiting.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001108.wav|1|100000|- take care of everything else.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001109.wav|1|100000|Give him a fucking mustache.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001110.wav|1|100000|That's enough of that horseshit.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001111.wav|1|100000|- He gave me the explosives.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001112.wav|1|100000|You're really good at that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001113.wav|1|100000|What time is that, exactly?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001124.wav|1|100000|I asked her if she would check Alan's cellphone for any recently made calls.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001125.wav|1|100000|I'm real glad we have six months together before you have to go to...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001126.wav|1|100000|What difference does it make if my wife was in on it or not?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001127.wav|1|100000|I just want to say I'm-I'm so honored that you're-you're doing this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001129.wav|1|100000|I am falling for you, Caroline, and I'm pretty sure you feel the same.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001130.wav|1|100000|What it meant to you Was still another chance to move closer to blake.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001131.wav|1|100000|Let's go to a pet shop tomorrow and get a new cat, all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001132.wav|1|100000|You insisted that you would not be left at Casterly Rock under any circumstances.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001133.wav|1|100000|I'm really hoping that you and I can move forward with my book, Julianne.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001134.wav|1|100000|You will call an outsider in the middle of the night and tell him...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001135.wav|1|100000|I know you think you're saving your people, but you need to stop this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001136.wav|1|100000|You probably aren't the sort of person who is cut out for manipulating others.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001137.wav|1|100000|The guy hanging naked from the shower curtain rod... half dead from autoerotic asphyxiation?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001138.wav|1|100000|Well, just don't use no sticks or no knives or no piece of iron.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001139.wav|1|100000|Because now he'll have to stay with these people for a long, long time.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001140.wav|1|100000|An impairment of set-background discrimination can get you into a heap of trouble.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001141.wav|1|100000|It made you write a book about the seven steps to heal the heart?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001142.wav|1|100000|I heard that Ibaragi Doji who lives in Senjo-ga-take is a demon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001143.wav|1|100000|I cannot imagine what they will do if the cache is not returned whole.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001165.wav|1|100000|I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001166.wav|1|100000|Peter Jennings and Tom Brokaw have bald spots!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001167.wav|1|100000|I'm not gonna inquire about that right now.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001168.wav|1|100000|I'm only a messenger, that must be obvious.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001169.wav|1|100000|But I never stopped to think about it
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001170.wav|1|100000|Did you see the eyes on that thing?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001171.wav|1|100000|And when I look back from a distance,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001172.wav|1|100000|You have nothing to return to in Stockholm.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001173.wav|1|100000|Look, I just need a few more minutes.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001176.wav|1|100000|What did you want them to be, wrong?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001177.wav|1|100000|Uh, I can't believe how fat I look.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001178.wav|1|100000|I bought it at piggly wiggly for 95 cents.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001184.wav|1|100000|- This medicine doesn't do a bit of good.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001185.wav|1|100000|Does everyone in your business talk like that?

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001196.wav|1|100000|Great distraction, man!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001198.wav|1|100000|I say we slip the message into one of the dog's collars, round up some fleas, put them on the dog.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001202.wav|1|100000|We got to stick together, until we know how to play him or until he slips up, then we get him.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001212.wav|1|100000|Even if I don't know exactly what it is I do.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001214.wav|1|100000|Damn, if that don't feel like I got my balls back.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001215.wav|1|100000|All I know is that there is evil in the air..
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001216.wav|1|100000|And sooner or later we're gonna find where the money is.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001305.wav|1|100000|No, it's just, uh, she caught me at Dad's yesterday, and she really laid into me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001306.wav|1|100000|Very much what everyone...first thing that comes into their mind when they think about me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001307.wav|1|100000|I just spent more and more time at the diner, trying to make the place work.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001308.wav|1|100000|You know, you should check into Mr. Hennessey and see what he was doing last night.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001309.wav|1|100000|I think he hid it in the mineshaft, which is about a half a mile north.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001310.wav|1|100000|Do you know that for a fact, or is that just what you want to believe?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001311.wav|1|100000|Look, Chuck is my boyfriend, and he makes $12 an hour, so you stay away from him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001312.wav|1|100000|Because they definitely want me back, and I wanna be able to have the freedom to...

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001416.wav|1|100000|- Fine, once I got 'em six bags of chips and some fresh air.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001417.wav|1|100000|It's sort of the Dukes of Hazzard method of avoiding the cops, so...

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001419.wav|1|100000|Do you wanna punish me right now?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001420.wav|1|100000|What are you playing at this time?

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001425.wav|1|100000|- I expect you to tell the truth.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001426.wav|1|100000|And what is your period, Mr. Smart?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001427.wav|1|100000|Take the room next to hers, Sonja.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001428.wav|1|100000|I've had enough excitement for one life.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001429.wav|1|100000|And poor Mary, she was so scared.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001430.wav|1|100000|- Did you use that as bait so--
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001431.wav|1|100000|I know what dengue fever is like.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001432.wav|1|100000|But break it gently she is old ...

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001452.wav|1|100000|I slept with Jacob once when I had to go to his house to pick up my dogs.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001453.wav|1|100000|You know, I've been thinking, when you blew up your car back there, you blew up mine, too.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001455.wav|1|100000|I'm just going to go and talk to Daddy for a few minutes... and I'll be right back.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001457.wav|1|100000|I also built that library and used it to help a dozen guys get a high school diploma.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001511.wav|1|100000|I think she wants me to rub olive oil on your taint.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001520.wav|1|100000|Why did you come with a pistol and point it at Tony?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001521.wav|1|100000|I realized I knew Herbert Gelman only after I'd heard his testimony.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001522.wav|1|100000|Meaningless words... you say, as you exhale to slow down the breath.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001523.wav|1|100000|L'm here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001524.wav|1|100000|But, but...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001525.wav|1|100000|Our classmate.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001526.wav|1|100000|- What, Colette?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001527.wav|1|100000|What's wrong?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001528.wav|1|100000|(GONG SOUNDING)
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001529.wav|1|100000|Let's talk.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001541.wav|1|100000|Do you need ammo, guns?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001542.wav|1|100000|Why are you still here?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001543.wav|1|100000|His bullets untraceable of course.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001544.wav|1|100000|- First, our hosts attacked us.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001545.wav|1|100000|Your hair is so pretty.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001546.wav|1|100000|Shall we arrange this way
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001547.wav|1|100000|Don't lie to me, Logan.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001548.wav|1|100000|I won't show any mercy!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001549.wav|1|100000|- Not a sound all night.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001550.wav|1|100000|And you will be crushed.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001551.wav|1|100000|I've been walking for miles.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001552.wav|1|100000|Yeah. I'm glad you weren't.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001553.wav|1|100000|My wedding can suck it?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001554.wav|1|100000|This isn't the real list.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001555.wav|1|100000|I'm too fast for TV.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001556.wav|1|100000|I got these shoes here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001557.wav|1|100000|The Tysons are here waiting.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001558.wav|1|100000|- take care of everything else.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001559.wav|1|100000|Give him a fucking mustache.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001560.wav|1|100000|That's enough of that horseshit.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001561.wav|1|100000|- He gave me the explosives.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001562.wav|1|100000|You're really good at that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001563.wav|1|100000|What time is that, exactly?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001574.wav|1|100000|I asked her if she would check Alan's cellphone for any recently made calls.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001575.wav|1|100000|I'm real glad we have six months together before you have to go to...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001576.wav|1|100000|What difference does it make if my wife was in on it or not?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001577.wav|1|100000|I just want to say I'm-I'm so honored that you're-you're doing this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001579.wav|1|100000|I am falling for you, Caroline, and I'm pretty sure you feel the same.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001580.wav|1|100000|What it meant to you Was still another chance to move closer to blake.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001581.wav|1|100000|Let's go to a pet shop tomorrow and get a new cat, all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001582.wav|1|100000|You insisted that you would not be left at Casterly Rock under any circumstances.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001583.wav|1|100000|I'm really hoping that you and I can move forward with my book, Julianne.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001584.wav|1|100000|You will call an outsider in the middle of the night and tell him...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001585.wav|1|100000|I know you think you're saving your people, but you need to stop this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001586.wav|1|100000|You probably aren't the sort of person who is cut out for manipulating others.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001587.wav|1|100000|The guy hanging naked from the shower curtain rod... half dead from autoerotic asphyxiation?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001588.wav|1|100000|Well, just don't use no sticks or no knives or no piece of iron.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001589.wav|1|100000|Because now he'll have to stay with these people for a long, long time.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001590.wav|1|100000|An impairment of set-background discrimination can get you into a heap of trouble.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001591.wav|1|100000|It made you write a book about the seven steps to heal the heart?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001592.wav|1|100000|I heard that Ibaragi Doji who lives in Senjo-ga-take is a demon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001593.wav|1|100000|I cannot imagine what they will do if the cache is not returned whole.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001594.wav|1|100000|We would love to save your princess, but are looking for two royal geeks.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001595.wav|1|100000|If you came to say more cruel things to me, I'm going to bed.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001614.wav|1|100000|Easy on the gin, heavy on the tonic.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001615.wav|1|100000|I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001616.wav|1|100000|Peter Jennings and Tom Brokaw have bald spots!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001617.wav|1|100000|I'm not gonna inquire about that right now.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001618.wav|1|100000|I'm only a messenger, that must be obvious.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001619.wav|1|100000|But I never stopped to think about it
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001620.wav|1|100000|Did you see the eyes on that thing?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001621.wav|1|100000|And when I look back from a distance,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001622.wav|1|100000|You have nothing to return to in Stockholm.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001623.wav|1|100000|Look, I just need a few more minutes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001624.wav|1|100000|- Don, I can't seem to access this site.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001625.wav|1|100000|Don't you think his stomach is really big?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001626.wav|1|100000|What did you want them to be, wrong?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001627.wav|1|100000|Uh, I can't believe how fat I look.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001628.wav|1|100000|I bought it at piggly wiggly for 95 cents.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001629.wav|1|100000|When they rob you, you don't take money.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001630.wav|1|100000|They killed my boy and just drove on...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001631.wav|1|100000|Are you or are you not the Messiah?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001632.wav|1|100000|It was Eva Marie Saint and Sal Mineo.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001633.wav|1|100000|So let me put this simply for you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001634.wav|1|100000|- This medicine doesn't do a bit of good.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001635.wav|1|100000|Does everyone in your business talk like that?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001636.wav|1|100000|- Leave him alone!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001637.wav|1|100000|Small fucking towns.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001638.wav|1|100000|- You see him?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001639.wav|1|100000|Sorry about that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001640.wav|1|100000|- Uh, this morning.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001641.wav|1|100000|- We'll get you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001642.wav|1|100000|I have supersperm!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001643.wav|1|100000|2nd Platoon, listen up.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001644.wav|1|100000|Not this time.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001645.wav|1|100000|Yet firm too.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001646.wav|1|100000|Great distraction, man!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001648.wav|1|100000|I say we slip the message into one of the dog's collars, round up some fleas, put them on the dog.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001652.wav|1|100000|We got to stick together, until we know how to play him or until he slips up, then we get him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001657.wav|1|100000|If you wanna help the public and do your jobs best, sit quietly and listen to what I have to say.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001661.wav|1|100000|We just wanted to get married quietly, without any hoo-ha.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001662.wav|1|100000|Even if I don't know exactly what it is I do.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001663.wav|1|100000|Trouble is, Ann, when I'm standin' up my mind's lyin' down.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001664.wav|1|100000|Damn, if that don't feel like I got my balls back.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001665.wav|1|100000|All I know is that there is evil in the air..
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001666.wav|1|100000|And sooner or later we're gonna find where the money is.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001667.wav|1|100000|Mrs. Faber confessed to stabbing Rocco with her husband's knife once.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001668.wav|1|100000|You'll have to fill out a few of these forms, but...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001669.wav|1|100000|Well, my friend, all is not well on the hippie front.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001670.wav|1|100000|She's probably in black velvet with a feather in her hair.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001671.wav|1|100000|Tonight, I prefer to just dine in the shadows, thank you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001672.wav|1|100000|Sometimes the enemy of my enemy is my friend, Agent Gibbs.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001673.wav|1|100000|For not turning you back over to the marshals to hang.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001674.wav|1|100000|Just for what Master Wang has said, we are all Chinese.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001675.wav|1|100000|Um, can you call me back when you get this, please?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001676.wav|1|100000|So, is he the man of your life, or what happened?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001677.wav|1|100000|When white people see me coming into their store, they run.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001679.wav|1|100000|Oh!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001680.wav|1|100000|Yes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001702.wav|1|100000|Venus cannot be her real name.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001703.wav|1|100000|- It was Teru Mikami's own decision...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001704.wav|1|100000|Just when we need him most.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001705.wav|1|100000|You look like you've been crying.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001706.wav|1|100000|Oh, just a spare power cell.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001707.wav|1|100000|You don't want to marry him?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001708.wav|1|100000|Bobby, you're to remember this number.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001709.wav|1|100000|No one has to die here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001710.wav|1|100000|I have an audition on Friday.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001711.wav|1|100000|# You workin' that, you trickin' that
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001712.wav|1|100000|Have fun together while I'm gone.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001713.wav|1|100000|He was only good in crafts!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001714.wav|1|100000|I am not making an accusation.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001729.wav|1|100000|He's a man, who kills when he wants to, if I want to, no power on earth can stop me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001753.wav|1|100000|No, it--it--it sounds weird, but it was totally a spur-of-the-moment thing,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001755.wav|1|100000|No, it's just, uh, she caught me at Dad's yesterday, and she really laid into me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001756.wav|1|100000|Very much what everyone...first thing that comes into their mind when they think about me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001757.wav|1|100000|I just spent more and more time at the diner, trying to make the place work.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001758.wav|1|100000|You know, you should check into Mr. Hennessey and see what he was doing last night.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001759.wav|1|100000|I think he hid it in the mineshaft, which is about a half a mile north.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001760.wav|1|100000|Do you know that for a fact, or is that just what you want to believe?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001761.wav|1|100000|Look, Chuck is my boyfriend, and he makes $12 an hour, so you stay away from him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001762.wav|1|100000|Because they definitely want me back, and I wanna be able to have the freedom to...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001763.wav|1|100000|We'll do a second line of resistance up there, on the hill, two hundred meters away.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001768.wav|1|100000|You can believe that!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001769.wav|1|100000|I'm looking for Pboo.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001770.wav|1|100000|Hayes at the plate.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001771.wav|1|100000|- Mister, you all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001772.wav|1|100000|Guys, my back hurts.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001773.wav|1|100000|What is going on?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001774.wav|1|100000|Garza's alibi checks out!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001775.wav|1|100000|No baby, come here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001776.wav|1|100000|Come watch the show.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001778.wav|1|100000|Let me see that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001779.wav|1|100000|And then I'm frightened.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001863.wav|1|4|I just wanted you to loosen up, have a good time - lt's okay.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001864.wav|1|4|I'm just going to agitate some of your molecules and split them apart.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001865.wav|1|4|None of this would have been possible if you hadn't trusted the Cylon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001866.wav|1|100000|- Fine, once I got 'em six bags of chips and some fresh air.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001867.wav|1|100000|It's sort of the Dukes of Hazzard method of avoiding the cops, so...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001868.wav|1|100000|Because you were talking with Vincent's wife.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001869.wav|1|100000|Do you wanna punish me right now?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001870.wav|1|100000|What are you playing at this time?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001871.wav|1|100000|Forget all this is out here sometimes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001872.wav|1|100000|What did you say your name was?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001873.wav|1|100000|But really, I admire you very much.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001874.wav|1|100000|You made my sister spit at me
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001875.wav|1|100000|- I expect you to tell the truth.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0001_001876.wav|1|100000|And what is your period, Mr. Smart?

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000204.wav|2|100000|This isn't the real list.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000205.wav|2|100000|I'm too fast for TV.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000206.wav|2|100000|I got these shoes here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000207.wav|2|100000|The Tysons are here waiting.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000208.wav|2|100000|- take care of everything else.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000209.wav|2|100000|Give him a fucking mustache.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000210.wav|2|100000|That's enough of that horseshit.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000211.wav|2|100000|- He gave me the explosives.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000212.wav|2|100000|You're really good at that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000213.wav|2|100000|What time is that, exactly?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000224.wav|2|100000|I asked her if she would check Alan's cellphone for any recently made calls.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000225.wav|2|100000|I'm real glad we have six months together before you have to go to...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000226.wav|2|100000|What difference does it make if my wife was in on it or not?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000227.wav|2|100000|I just want to say I'm-I'm so honored that you're-you're doing this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000229.wav|2|100000|I am falling for you, Caroline, and I'm pretty sure you feel the same.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000230.wav|2|100000|What it meant to you Was still another chance to move closer to blake.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000231.wav|2|100000|Let's go to a pet shop tomorrow and get a new cat, all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000232.wav|2|100000|You insisted that you would not be left at Casterly Rock under any circumstances.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000233.wav|2|100000|I'm really hoping that you and I can move forward with my book, Julianne.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000234.wav|2|100000|You will call an outsider in the middle of the night and tell him...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000235.wav|2|100000|I know you think you're saving your people, but you need to stop this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000236.wav|2|100000|You probably aren't the sort of person who is cut out for manipulating others.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000237.wav|2|100000|The guy hanging naked from the shower curtain rod... half dead from autoerotic asphyxiation?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000238.wav|2|100000|Well, just don't use no sticks or no knives or no piece of iron.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000239.wav|2|100000|Because now he'll have to stay with these people for a long, long time.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000240.wav|2|100000|An impairment of set-background discrimination can get you into a heap of trouble.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000241.wav|2|100000|It made you write a book about the seven steps to heal the heart?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000242.wav|2|100000|I heard that Ibaragi Doji who lives in Senjo-ga-take is a demon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000243.wav|2|100000|I cannot imagine what they will do if the cache is not returned whole.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000244.wav|2|100000|We would love to save your princess, but are looking for two royal geeks.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000245.wav|2|100000|If you came to say more cruel things to me, I'm going to bed.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000264.wav|2|100000|Easy on the gin, heavy on the tonic.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000265.wav|2|100000|I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000266.wav|2|100000|Peter Jennings and Tom Brokaw have bald spots!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000267.wav|2|100000|I'm not gonna inquire about that right now.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000268.wav|2|100000|I'm only a messenger, that must be obvious.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000269.wav|2|100000|But I never stopped to think about it
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000270.wav|2|100000|Did you see the eyes on that thing?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000271.wav|2|100000|And when I look back from a distance,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000272.wav|2|100000|You have nothing to return to in Stockholm.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000273.wav|2|100000|Look, I just need a few more minutes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000274.wav|2|100000|- Don, I can't seem to access this site.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000275.wav|2|100000|Don't you think his stomach is really big?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000276.wav|2|100000|What did you want them to be, wrong?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000277.wav|2|100000|Uh, I can't believe how fat I look.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000278.wav|2|100000|I bought it at piggly wiggly for 95 cents.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000279.wav|2|100000|When they rob you, you don't take money.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000280.wav|2|100000|They killed my boy and just drove on...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000281.wav|2|100000|Are you or are you not the Messiah?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000282.wav|2|100000|It was Eva Marie Saint and Sal Mineo.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000283.wav|2|100000|So let me put this simply for you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000284.wav|2|100000|- This medicine doesn't do a bit of good.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000285.wav|2|100000|Does everyone in your business talk like that?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000286.wav|2|100000|- Leave him alone!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000287.wav|2|100000|Small fucking towns.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000288.wav|2|100000|- You see him?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000289.wav|2|100000|Sorry about that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000290.wav|2|100000|- Uh, this morning.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000291.wav|2|100000|- We'll get you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000292.wav|2|100000|I have supersperm!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000293.wav|2|100000|2nd Platoon, listen up.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000294.wav|2|100000|Not this time.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000295.wav|2|100000|Yet firm too.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000296.wav|2|100000|Great distraction, man!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000298.wav|2|100000|I say we slip the message into one of the dog's collars, round up some fleas, put them on the dog.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000302.wav|2|100000|We got to stick together, until we know how to play him or until he slips up, then we get him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000307.wav|2|100000|If you wanna help the public and do your jobs best, sit quietly and listen to what I have to say.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000311.wav|2|100000|We just wanted to get married quietly, without any hoo-ha.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000312.wav|2|100000|Even if I don't know exactly what it is I do.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000313.wav|2|100000|Trouble is, Ann, when I'm standin' up my mind's lyin' down.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000314.wav|2|100000|Damn, if that don't feel like I got my balls back.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000315.wav|2|100000|All I know is that there is evil in the air..
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000316.wav|2|100000|And sooner or later we're gonna find where the money is.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000317.wav|2|100000|Mrs. Faber confessed to stabbing Rocco with her husband's knife once.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000318.wav|2|100000|You'll have to fill out a few of these forms, but...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000319.wav|2|100000|Well, my friend, all is not well on the hippie front.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000320.wav|2|100000|She's probably in black velvet with a feather in her hair.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000321.wav|2|100000|Tonight, I prefer to just dine in the shadows, thank you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000322.wav|2|100000|Sometimes the enemy of my enemy is my friend, Agent Gibbs.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000323.wav|2|100000|For not turning you back over to the marshals to hang.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000324.wav|2|100000|Just for what Master Wang has said, we are all Chinese.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000325.wav|2|100000|Um, can you call me back when you get this, please?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000326.wav|2|100000|So, is he the man of your life, or what happened?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000327.wav|2|100000|When white people see me coming into their store, they run.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000328.wav|2|100000|(GRUNTING)
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000329.wav|2|100000|Oh!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000330.wav|2|100000|Yes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000352.wav|2|100000|Venus cannot be her real name.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000353.wav|2|100000|- It was Teru Mikami's own decision...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000354.wav|2|100000|Just when we need him most.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000355.wav|2|100000|You look like you've been crying.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000356.wav|2|100000|Oh, just a spare power cell.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000357.wav|2|100000|You don't want to marry him?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000358.wav|2|100000|Bobby, you're to remember this number.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000359.wav|2|100000|No one has to die here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000360.wav|2|100000|I have an audition on Friday.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000361.wav|2|100000|# You workin' that, you trickin' that
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000362.wav|2|100000|Have fun together while I'm gone.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000363.wav|2|100000|He was only good in crafts!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000364.wav|2|100000|I am not making an accusation.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000379.wav|2|100000|He's a man, who kills when he wants to, if I want to, no power on earth can stop me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000403.wav|2|100000|No, it--it--it sounds weird, but it was totally a spur-of-the-moment thing,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000405.wav|2|100000|No, it's just, uh, she caught me at Dad's yesterday, and she really laid into me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000406.wav|2|100000|Very much what everyone...first thing that comes into their mind when they think about me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000407.wav|2|100000|I just spent more and more time at the diner, trying to make the place work.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000408.wav|2|100000|You know, you should check into Mr. Hennessey and see what he was doing last night.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000409.wav|2|100000|I think he hid it in the mineshaft, which is about a half a mile north.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000410.wav|2|100000|Do you know that for a fact, or is that just what you want to believe?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000411.wav|2|100000|Look, Chuck is my boyfriend, and he makes $12 an hour, so you stay away from him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000412.wav|2|100000|Because they definitely want me back, and I wanna be able to have the freedom to...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000413.wav|2|100000|We'll do a second line of resistance up there, on the hill, two hundred meters away.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000418.wav|2|100000|You can believe that!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000419.wav|2|100000|I'm looking for Pboo.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000420.wav|2|100000|Hayes at the plate.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000421.wav|2|100000|- Mister, you all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000422.wav|2|100000|Guys, my back hurts.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000423.wav|2|100000|What is going on?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000424.wav|2|100000|Garza's alibi checks out!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000425.wav|2|100000|No baby, come here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000426.wav|2|100000|Come watch the show.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000427.wav|2|100000|BIRTH CERTIFICATE - FATHER UNKNOWN
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000428.wav|2|100000|Let me see that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000429.wav|2|100000|And then I'm frightened.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000513.wav|2|1|I just wanted you to loosen up, have a good time - lt's okay.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000514.wav|2|1|I'm just going to agitate some of your molecules and split them apart.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000515.wav|2|1|None of this would have been possible if you hadn't trusted the Cylon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000516.wav|2|100000|- Fine, once I got 'em six bags of chips and some fresh air.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000517.wav|2|100000|It's sort of the Dukes of Hazzard method of avoiding the cops, so...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000518.wav|2|100000|Because you were talking with Vincent's wife.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000519.wav|2|100000|Do you wanna punish me right now?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000520.wav|2|100000|What are you playing at this time?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000521.wav|2|100000|Forget all this is out here sometimes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000522.wav|2|100000|What did you say your name was?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000523.wav|2|100000|But really, I admire you very much.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000524.wav|2|100000|You made my sister spit at me
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000525.wav|2|100000|- I expect you to tell the truth.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000526.wav|2|100000|And what is your period, Mr. Smart?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000527.wav|2|100000|Take the room next to hers, Sonja.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000528.wav|2|100000|I've had enough excitement for one life.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000529.wav|2|100000|And poor Mary, she was so scared.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000530.wav|2|100000|- Did you use that as bait so--
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000531.wav|2|100000|I know what dengue fever is like.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000532.wav|2|100000|But break it gently she is old ...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000533.wav|2|100000|We don't make anything off that one.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000534.wav|2|100000|- some manner of harm many moons ago.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000535.wav|2|100000|Hey, o'neill, hand me a bear claw.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000536.wav|2|100000|Is impossible to keep this from Washington
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000551.wav|2|100000|What they do... is they will sit up in this higher energy state... and then drop down again.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000552.wav|2|100000|I slept with Jacob once when I had to go to his house to pick up my dogs.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000553.wav|2|100000|You know, I've been thinking, when you blew up your car back there, you blew up mine, too.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000555.wav|2|100000|I'm just going to go and talk to Daddy for a few minutes... and I'll be right back.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000557.wav|2|100000|I also built that library and used it to help a dozen guys get a high school diploma.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000558.wav|2|100000|No, that is an example of map... I've seen maps, certainly, that have my road on, for example.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000559.wav|2|100000|There are contractors that show up in pickup trucks, and they kind of watch you and surveil you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000572.wav|2|100000|Rest those little bones, while I go out and make a goddamn fool of myself.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000573.wav|2|100000|I can get you an achilles tendon in South Korea for anywhere between $200 and $1,200 dollars.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000805.wav|2|100000|You look like you've been crying.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000806.wav|2|100000|Oh, just a spare power cell.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000807.wav|2|100000|You don't want to marry him?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000808.wav|2|100000|Bobby, you're to remember this number.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000809.wav|2|100000|No one has to die here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000810.wav|2|100000|I have an audition on Friday.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000811.wav|2|100000|# You workin' that, you trickin' that
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000812.wav|2|100000|Have fun together while I'm gone.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000813.wav|2|100000|He was only good in crafts!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000814.wav|2|100000|I am not making an accusation.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000829.wav|2|100000|He's a man, who kills when he wants to, if I want to, no power on earth can stop me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000853.wav|2|100000|No, it--it--it sounds weird, but it was totally a spur-of-the-moment thing,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000855.wav|2|100000|No, it's just, uh, she caught me at Dad's yesterday, and she really laid into me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000856.wav|2|100000|Very much what everyone...first thing that comes into their mind when they think about me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000857.wav|2|100000|I just spent more and more time at the diner, trying to make the place work.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000858.wav|2|100000|You know, you should check into Mr. Hennessey and see what he was doing last night.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000859.wav|2|100000|I think he hid it in the mineshaft, which is about a half a mile north.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000860.wav|2|100000|Do you know that for a fact, or is that just what you want to believe?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000861.wav|2|100000|Look, Chuck is my boyfriend, and he makes $12 an hour, so you stay away from him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000862.wav|2|100000|Because they definitely want me back, and I wanna be able to have the freedom to...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000863.wav|2|100000|We'll do a second line of resistance up there, on the hill, two hundred meters away.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000868.wav|2|100000|You can believe that!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000869.wav|2|100000|I'm looking for Pboo.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000872.wav|2|100000|Guys, my back hurts.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000873.wav|2|100000|What is going on?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000874.wav|2|100000|Garza's alibi checks out!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000875.wav|2|100000|No baby, come here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000876.wav|2|100000|Come watch the show.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000877.wav|2|100000|BIRTH CERTIFICATE - FATHER UNKNOWN
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000878.wav|2|100000|Let me see that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000879.wav|2|100000|And then I'm frightened.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000963.wav|2|2|I just wanted you to loosen up, have a good time - lt's okay.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000964.wav|2|2|I'm just going to agitate some of your molecules and split them apart.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000965.wav|2|2|None of this would have been possible if you hadn't trusted the Cylon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000966.wav|2|100000|- Fine, once I got 'em six bags of chips and some fresh air.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000967.wav|2|100000|It's sort of the Dukes of Hazzard method of avoiding the cops, so...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000968.wav|2|100000|Because you were talking with Vincent's wife.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000969.wav|2|100000|Do you wanna punish me right now?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000970.wav|2|100000|What are you playing at this time?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000971.wav|2|100000|Forget all this is out here sometimes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000972.wav|2|100000|What did you say your name was?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000973.wav|2|100000|But really, I admire you very much.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000974.wav|2|100000|You made my sister spit at me
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000975.wav|2|100000|- I expect you to tell the truth.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000976.wav|2|100000|And what is your period, Mr. Smart?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000977.wav|2|100000|Take the room next to hers, Sonja.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000978.wav|2|100000|I've had enough excitement for one life.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000979.wav|2|100000|And poor Mary, she was so scared.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000980.wav|2|100000|- Did you use that as bait so--
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000981.wav|2|100000|I know what dengue fever is like.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000982.wav|2|100000|But break it gently she is old ...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000983.wav|2|100000|We don't make anything off that one.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_000984.wav|2|100000|- some manner of harm many moons ago.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001001.wav|2|100000|What they do... is they will sit up in this higher energy state... and then drop down again.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001002.wav|2|100000|I slept with Jacob once when I had to go to his house to pick up my dogs.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001003.wav|2|100000|You know, I've been thinking, when you blew up your car back there, you blew up mine, too.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001005.wav|2|100000|I'm just going to go and talk to Daddy for a few minutes... and I'll be right back.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001007.wav|2|100000|I also built that library and used it to help a dozen guys get a high school diploma.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001008.wav|2|100000|No, that is an example of map... I've seen maps, certainly, that have my road on, for example.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001009.wav|2|100000|There are contractors that show up in pickup trucks, and they kind of watch you and surveil you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001022.wav|2|100000|Rest those little bones, while I go out and make a goddamn fool of myself.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001023.wav|2|100000|I can get you an achilles tendon in South Korea for anywhere between $200 and $1,200 dollars.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001024.wav|2|100000|- I could have a thousand years with you, and it would still be too soon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001025.wav|2|100000|What is the reason you were in the desert so close to the Mexican border?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001026.wav|2|100000|Why does everyone feel the need to have these things, these, like, symbols of adulthood?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001027.wav|2|100000|We were supposed to go to Opera House in it and conduct a big raid.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001028.wav|2|100000|I've been keeping it a secret for months, and I'm going to stop hiding it.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001029.wav|2|100000|At the end of the month, I get a bonus, 10% of anything the horses make.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001030.wav|2|100000|The other two were floating in the hotel pool, and they weren't doing the backstroke.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001031.wav|2|100000|You know, I should've just done the full nickel the first time you busted me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001032.wav|2|100000|That guy's got two heads, a foot of reach on us, and no blind spot.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001033.wav|2|100000|One's the Bible, one's a book on Christmas... one's on how to be a carpenter.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001034.wav|2|100000|The safety of every man here rests with me, Caulder, and I can't trust you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001035.wav|2|100000|The world, you see, though it appears to be expanding infinitely, is truthfully quite small.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001036.wav|2|100000|- Yeah, an adult bear was milked half a dozen times, and then killed for this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001037.wav|2|100000|lot of lost souls took shepherd's call for blood seriously-- family values at its worst.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001038.wav|2|100000|Derek, I'd like to speak with your mom for a moment, is that all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001039.wav|2|100000|I'm Taylor's mother and I was just wondering if you created a fake profile online?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001040.wav|2|100000|Every time Brandon has a blow-up it's, like, always pointed at a stronger woman.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001041.wav|2|100000|So, I told him I'd give him a quick B.J. If he laid off.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001042.wav|2|100000|"Next day it was back to life back to reality"
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001043.wav|2|100000|I object to working on this case on moral grounds.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001047.wav|2|100000|Do me a favor, I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001048.wav|2|100000|I should get my dad a new pair of shoes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001049.wav|2|100000|Am I gonna have to hear this from you, too?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001050.wav|2|100000|Sark has demanded that you open her coffin for him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001051.wav|2|100000|Don't be so chatty, have your drink and move on.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001054.wav|2|100000|Why don't we just get it all out in open?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001055.wav|2|100000|- If you don't like me, let's get him someone else.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001056.wav|2|100000|Frank's not a guy that usually comes up with plans.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001057.wav|2|100000|I don't just abandon people when they leave the TARDIS.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001058.wav|2|100000|The Jews, those in the work squads, thought at first...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001059.wav|2|100000|All he done was to recommend Demetrius to the bank.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001060.wav|2|100000|What if Joan and Arthur cave to State and send her home?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001061.wav|2|100000|I think she wants me to rub olive oil on your taint.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001062.wav|2|100000|They were yelling at him, "Mr President, we need you to act!"
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001063.wav|2|100000|Yeah, in the 1920s a cat burglar named Nigel Hubbard left no fingerprints.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001064.wav|2|100000|- My father's had that book in a drawer since I was born.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001065.wav|2|100000|The risk of unpopular decision, competition, corruption, passivity, have prevented any action.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001066.wav|2|100000|I've always been a rational man with a great faith in science.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001067.wav|2|100000|If I had a big hollywood guy like you on my team,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001068.wav|2|100000|I don't think her boyfriend was too happy about her moving out.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001069.wav|2|100000|But this incident has helped me gain a new respect for him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001070.wav|2|100000|Why did you come with a pistol and point it at Tony?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001071.wav|2|100000|I realized I knew Herbert Gelman only after I'd heard his testimony.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001072.wav|2|100000|Meaningless words... you say, as you exhale to slow down the breath.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001073.wav|2|100000|L'm here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001074.wav|2|100000|But, but...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001075.wav|2|100000|Our classmate.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001076.wav|2|100000|- What, Colette?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001077.wav|2|100000|What's wrong?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001078.wav|2|100000|(GONG SOUNDING)
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001079.wav|2|100000|Let's talk.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001091.wav|2|100000|Do you need ammo, guns?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001092.wav|2|100000|Why are you still here?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001093.wav|2|100000|His bullets untraceable of course.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001094.wav|2|100000|- First, our hosts attacked us.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001095.wav|2|100000|Your hair is so pretty.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001096.wav|2|100000|Shall we arrange this way
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001097.wav|2|100000|Don't lie to me, Logan.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001098.wav|2|100000|I won't show any mercy!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001099.wav|2|100000|- Not a sound all night.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001100.wav|2|100000|And you will be crushed.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001101.wav|2|100000|I've been walking for miles.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001102.wav|2|100000|Yeah. I'm glad you weren't.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001103.wav|2|100000|My wedding can suck it?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001104.wav|2|100000|This isn't the real list.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001105.wav|2|100000|I'm too fast for TV.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001106.wav|2|100000|I got these shoes here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001107.wav|2|100000|The Tysons are here waiting.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001108.wav|2|100000|- take care of everything else.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001109.wav|2|100000|Give him a fucking mustache.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001110.wav|2|100000|That's enough of that horseshit.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001111.wav|2|100000|- He gave me the explosives.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001112.wav|2|100000|You're really good at that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001113.wav|2|100000|What time is that, exactly?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001124.wav|2|100000|I asked her if she would check Alan's cellphone for any recently made calls.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001125.wav|2|100000|I'm real glad we have six months together before you have to go to...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001126.wav|2|100000|What difference does it make if my wife was in on it or not?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001127.wav|2|100000|I just want to say I'm-I'm so honored that you're-you're doing this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001129.wav|2|100000|I am falling for you, Caroline, and I'm pretty sure you feel the same.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001130.wav|2|100000|What it meant to you Was still another chance to move closer to blake.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001131.wav|2|100000|Let's go to a pet shop tomorrow and get a new cat, all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001132.wav|2|100000|You insisted that you would not be left at Casterly Rock under any circumstances.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001133.wav|2|100000|I'm really hoping that you and I can move forward with my book, Julianne.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001134.wav|2|100000|You will call an outsider in the middle of the night and tell him...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001135.wav|2|100000|I know you think you're saving your people, but you need to stop this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001136.wav|2|100000|You probably aren't the sort of person who is cut out for manipulating others.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001137.wav|2|100000|The guy hanging naked from the shower curtain rod... half dead from autoerotic asphyxiation?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001138.wav|2|100000|Well, just don't use no sticks or no knives or no piece of iron.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001139.wav|2|100000|Because now he'll have to stay with these people for a long, long time.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001140.wav|2|100000|An impairment of set-background discrimination can get you into a heap of trouble.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001141.wav|2|100000|It made you write a book about the seven steps to heal the heart?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001142.wav|2|100000|I heard that Ibaragi Doji who lives in Senjo-ga-take is a demon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001143.wav|2|100000|I cannot imagine what they will do if the cache is not returned whole.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001145.wav|2|100000|If you came to say more cruel things to me, I'm going to bed.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001164.wav|2|100000|Easy on the gin, heavy on the tonic.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001165.wav|2|100000|I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001166.wav|2|100000|Peter Jennings and Tom Brokaw have bald spots!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001167.wav|2|100000|I'm not gonna inquire about that right now.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001168.wav|2|100000|I'm only a messenger, that must be obvious.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001169.wav|2|100000|But I never stopped to think about it
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001170.wav|2|100000|Did you see the eyes on that thing?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001171.wav|2|100000|And when I look back from a distance,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001172.wav|2|100000|You have nothing to return to in Stockholm.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001173.wav|2|100000|Look, I just need a few more minutes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001174.wav|2|100000|- Don, I can't seem to access this site.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001175.wav|2|100000|Don't you think his stomach is really big?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001176.wav|2|100000|What did you want them to be, wrong?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001177.wav|2|100000|Uh, I can't believe how fat I look.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001178.wav|2|100000|I bought it at piggly wiggly for 95 cents.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001179.wav|2|100000|When they rob you, you don't take money.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001180.wav|2|100000|They killed my boy and just drove on...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001181.wav|2|100000|Are you or are you not the Messiah?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001182.wav|2|100000|It was Eva Marie Saint and Sal Mineo.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001183.wav|2|100000|So let me put this simply for you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001184.wav|2|100000|- This medicine doesn't do a bit of good.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001185.wav|2|100000|Does everyone in your business talk like that?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001186.wav|2|100000|- Leave him alone!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001187.wav|2|100000|Small fucking towns.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001188.wav|2|100000|- You see him?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001189.wav|2|100000|Sorry about that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001190.wav|2|100000|- Uh, this morning.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001191.wav|2|100000|- We'll get you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001192.wav|2|100000|I have supersperm!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001193.wav|2|100000|2nd Platoon, listen up.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001194.wav|2|100000|Not this time.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001195.wav|2|100000|Yet firm too.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001196.wav|2|100000|Great distraction, man!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001198.wav|2|100000|I say we slip the message into one of the dog's collars, round up some fleas, put them on the dog.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001202.wav|2|100000|We got to stick together, until we know how to play him or until he slips up, then we get him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001207.wav|2|100000|If you wanna help the public and do your jobs best, sit quietly and listen to what I have to say.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001211.wav|2|100000|We just wanted to get married quietly, without any hoo-ha.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001212.wav|2|100000|Even if I don't know exactly what it is I do.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001213.wav|2|100000|Trouble is, Ann, when I'm standin' up my mind's lyin' down.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001214.wav|2|100000|Damn, if that don't feel like I got my balls back.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001215.wav|2|100000|All I know is that there is evil in the air..
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001216.wav|2|100000|And sooner or later we're gonna find where the money is.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001217.wav|2|100000|Mrs. Faber confessed to stabbing Rocco with her husband's knife once.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001219.wav|2|100000|Well, my friend, all is not well on the hippie front.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001220.wav|2|100000|She's probably in black velvet with a feather in her hair.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001221.wav|2|100000|Tonight, I prefer to just dine in the shadows, thank you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001222.wav|2|100000|Sometimes the enemy of my enemy is my friend, Agent Gibbs.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001223.wav|2|100000|For not turning you back over to the marshals to hang.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001224.wav|2|100000|Just for what Master Wang has said, we are all Chinese.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001225.wav|2|100000|Um, can you call me back when you get this, please?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001226.wav|2|100000|So, is he the man of your life, or what happened?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001227.wav|2|100000|When white people see me coming into their store, they run.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001229.wav|2|100000|Oh!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001230.wav|2|100000|Yes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001252.wav|2|100000|Venus cannot be her real name.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001253.wav|2|100000|- It was Teru Mikami's own decision...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001254.wav|2|100000|Just when we need him most.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001255.wav|2|100000|You look like you've been crying.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001256.wav|2|100000|Oh, just a spare power cell.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001257.wav|2|100000|You don't want to marry him?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001258.wav|2|100000|Bobby, you're to remember this number.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001259.wav|2|100000|No one has to die here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001260.wav|2|100000|I have an audition on Friday.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001261.wav|2|100000|# You workin' that, you trickin' that
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001262.wav|2|100000|Have fun together while I'm gone.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001263.wav|2|100000|He was only good in crafts!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001264.wav|2|100000|I am not making an accusation.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001279.wav|2|100000|He's a man, who kills when he wants to, if I want to, no power on earth can stop me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001303.wav|2|100000|No, it--it--it sounds weird, but it was totally a spur-of-the-moment thing,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001305.wav|2|100000|No, it's just, uh, she caught me at Dad's yesterday, and she really laid into me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001306.wav|2|100000|Very much what everyone...first thing that comes into their mind when they think about me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001307.wav|2|100000|I just spent more and more time at the diner, trying to make the place work.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001308.wav|2|100000|You know, you should check into Mr. Hennessey and see what he was doing last night.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001309.wav|2|100000|I think he hid it in the mineshaft, which is about a half a mile north.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001310.wav|2|100000|Do you know that for a fact, or is that just what you want to believe?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001311.wav|2|100000|Look, Chuck is my boyfriend, and he makes $12 an hour, so you stay away from him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001312.wav|2|100000|Because they definitely want me back, and I wanna be able to have the freedom to...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001313.wav|2|100000|We'll do a second line of resistance up there, on the hill, two hundred meters away.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001318.wav|2|100000|You can believe that!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001319.wav|2|100000|I'm looking for Pboo.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001320.wav|2|100000|Hayes at the plate.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001321.wav|2|100000|- Mister, you all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001322.wav|2|100000|Guys, my back hurts.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001323.wav|2|100000|What is going on?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001324.wav|2|100000|Garza's alibi checks out!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001325.wav|2|100000|No baby, come here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001326.wav|2|100000|Come watch the show.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001327.wav|2|100000|BIRTH CERTIFICATE - FATHER UNKNOWN
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001328.wav|2|100000|Let me see that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001329.wav|2|100000|And then I'm frightened.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001413.wav|2|3|I just wanted you to loosen up, have a good time - lt's okay.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001414.wav|2|3|I'm just going to agitate some of your molecules and split them apart.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001415.wav|2|3|None of this would have been possible if you hadn't trusted the Cylon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001416.wav|2|100000|- Fine, once I got 'em six bags of chips and some fresh air.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001417.wav|2|100000|It's sort of the Dukes of Hazzard method of avoiding the cops, so...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001418.wav|2|100000|Because you were talking with Vincent's wife.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001419.wav|2|100000|Do you wanna punish me right now?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001420.wav|2|100000|What are you playing at this time?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001421.wav|2|100000|Forget all this is out here sometimes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001422.wav|2|100000|What did you say your name was?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001423.wav|2|100000|But really, I admire you very much.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001424.wav|2|100000|You made my sister spit at me
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001425.wav|2|100000|- I expect you to tell the truth.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001426.wav|2|100000|And what is your period, Mr. Smart?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001427.wav|2|100000|Take the room next to hers, Sonja.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001428.wav|2|100000|I've had enough excitement for one life.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001429.wav|2|100000|And poor Mary, she was so scared.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001430.wav|2|100000|- Did you use that as bait so--
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001431.wav|2|100000|I know what dengue fever is like.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001432.wav|2|100000|But break it gently she is old ...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001433.wav|2|100000|We don't make anything off that one.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001434.wav|2|100000|- some manner of harm many moons ago.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001435.wav|2|100000|Hey, o'neill, hand me a bear claw.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001436.wav|2|100000|Is impossible to keep this from Washington
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001451.wav|2|100000|What they do... is they will sit up in this higher energy state... and then drop down again.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001452.wav|2|100000|I slept with Jacob once when I had to go to his house to pick up my dogs.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001453.wav|2|100000|You know, I've been thinking, when you blew up your car back there, you blew up mine, too.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001455.wav|2|100000|I'm just going to go and talk to Daddy for a few minutes... and I'll be right back.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001457.wav|2|100000|I also built that library and used it to help a dozen guys get a high school diploma.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001458.wav|2|100000|No, that is an example of map... I've seen maps, certainly, that have my road on, for example.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001459.wav|2|100000|There are contractors that show up in pickup trucks, and they kind of watch you and surveil you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001472.wav|2|100000|Rest those little bones, while I go out and make a goddamn fool of myself.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001473.wav|2|100000|I can get you an achilles tendon in South Korea for anywhere between $200 and $1,200 dollars.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001474.wav|2|100000|- I could have a thousand years with you, and it would still be too soon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001475.wav|2|100000|What is the reason you were in the desert so close to the Mexican border?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001476.wav|2|100000|Why does everyone feel the need to have these things, these, like, symbols of adulthood?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001477.wav|2|100000|We were supposed to go to Opera House in it and conduct a big raid.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001478.wav|2|100000|I've been keeping it a secret for months, and I'm going to stop hiding it.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001479.wav|2|100000|At the end of the month, I get a bonus, 10% of anything the horses make.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001480.wav|2|100000|The other two were floating in the hotel pool, and they weren't doing the backstroke.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001481.wav|2|100000|You know, I should've just done the full nickel the first time you busted me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001482.wav|2|100000|That guy's got two heads, a foot of reach on us, and no blind spot.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001483.wav|2|100000|One's the Bible, one's a book on Christmas... one's on how to be a carpenter.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001484.wav|2|100000|The safety of every man here rests with me, Caulder, and I can't trust you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001485.wav|2|100000|The world, you see, though it appears to be expanding infinitely, is truthfully quite small.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001486.wav|2|100000|- Yeah, an adult bear was milked half a dozen times, and then killed for this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001487.wav|2|100000|lot of lost souls took shepherd's call for blood seriously-- family values at its worst.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001488.wav|2|100000|Derek, I'd like to speak with your mom for a moment, is that all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001489.wav|2|100000|I'm Taylor's mother and I was just wondering if you created a fake profile online?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001490.wav|2|100000|Every time Brandon has a blow-up it's, like, always pointed at a stronger woman.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001491.wav|2|100000|So, I told him I'd give him a quick B.J. If he laid off.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001864.wav|2|4|I'm just going to agitate some of your molecules and split them apart.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001865.wav|2|4|None of this would have been possible if you hadn't trusted the Cylon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001866.wav|2|100000|- Fine, once I got 'em six bags of chips and some fresh air.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001867.wav|2|100000|It's sort of the Dukes of Hazzard method of avoiding the cops, so...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001868.wav|2|100000|Because you were talking with Vincent's wife.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001869.wav|2|100000|Do you wanna punish me right now?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001870.wav|2|100000|What are you playing at this time?

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001875.wav|2|100000|- I expect you to tell the truth.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001876.wav|2|100000|And what is your period, Mr. Smart?

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001905.wav|2|100000|I'm just going to go and talk to Daddy for a few minutes... and I'll be right back.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001907.wav|2|100000|I also built that library and used it to help a dozen guys get a high school diploma.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001925.wav|2|100000|What is the reason you were in the desert so close to the Mexican border?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001926.wav|2|100000|Why does everyone feel the need to have these things, these, like, symbols of adulthood?

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001956.wav|2|100000|Frank's not a guy that usually comes up with plans.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001957.wav|2|100000|I don't just abandon people when they leave the TARDIS.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001958.wav|2|100000|The Jews, those in the work squads, thought at first...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001959.wav|2|100000|All he done was to recommend Demetrius to the bank.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001960.wav|2|100000|What if Joan and Arthur cave to State and send her home?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001961.wav|2|100000|I think she wants me to rub olive oil on your taint.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001969.wav|2|100000|But this incident has helped me gain a new respect for him.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001971.wav|2|100000|I realized I knew Herbert Gelman only after I'd heard his testimony.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001972.wav|2|100000|Meaningless words... you say, as you exhale to slow down the breath.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001973.wav|2|100000|L'm here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001974.wav|2|100000|But, but...

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001992.wav|2|100000|Why are you still here?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001993.wav|2|100000|His bullets untraceable of course.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001994.wav|2|100000|- First, our hosts attacked us.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001995.wav|2|100000|Your hair is so pretty.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001996.wav|2|100000|Shall we arrange this way
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001997.wav|2|100000|Don't lie to me, Logan.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001998.wav|2|100000|I won't show any mercy!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_001999.wav|2|100000|- Not a sound all night.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002000.wav|2|100000|And you will be crushed.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002001.wav|2|100000|I've been walking for miles.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002002.wav|2|100000|Yeah. I'm glad you weren't.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002003.wav|2|100000|My wedding can suck it?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002004.wav|2|100000|This isn't the real list.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002005.wav|2|100000|I'm too fast for TV.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002006.wav|2|100000|I got these shoes here.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002010.wav|2|100000|That's enough of that horseshit.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002011.wav|2|100000|- He gave me the explosives.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002012.wav|2|100000|You're really good at that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002013.wav|2|100000|What time is that, exactly?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002024.wav|2|100000|I asked her if she would check Alan's cellphone for any recently made calls.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002025.wav|2|100000|I'm real glad we have six months together before you have to go to...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002026.wav|2|100000|What difference does it make if my wife was in on it or not?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002027.wav|2|100000|I just want to say I'm-I'm so honored that you're-you're doing this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002029.wav|2|100000|I am falling for you, Caroline, and I'm pretty sure you feel the same.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002031.wav|2|100000|Let's go to a pet shop tomorrow and get a new cat, all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002032.wav|2|100000|You insisted that you would not be left at Casterly Rock under any circumstances.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002033.wav|2|100000|I'm really hoping that you and I can move forward with my book, Julianne.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002034.wav|2|100000|You will call an outsider in the middle of the night and tell him...

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002036.wav|2|100000|You probably aren't the sort of person who is cut out for manipulating others.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002037.wav|2|100000|The guy hanging naked from the shower curtain rod... half dead from autoerotic asphyxiation?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002038.wav|2|100000|Well, just don't use no sticks or no knives or no piece of iron.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002039.wav|2|100000|Because now he'll have to stay with these people for a long, long time.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002071.wav|2|100000|And when I look back from a distance,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002072.wav|2|100000|You have nothing to return to in Stockholm.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002073.wav|2|100000|Look, I just need a few more minutes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002074.wav|2|100000|- Don, I can't seem to access this site.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002075.wav|2|100000|Don't you think his stomach is really big?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002076.wav|2|100000|What did you want them to be, wrong?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002077.wav|2|100000|Uh, I can't believe how fat I look.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002078.wav|2|100000|I bought it at piggly wiggly for 95 cents.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002079.wav|2|100000|When they rob you, you don't take money.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002080.wav|2|100000|They killed my boy and just drove on...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002081.wav|2|100000|Are you or are you not the Messiah?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002082.wav|2|100000|It was Eva Marie Saint and Sal Mineo.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002083.wav|2|100000|So let me put this simply for you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002084.wav|2|100000|- This medicine doesn't do a bit of good.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002085.wav|2|100000|Does everyone in your business talk like that?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002086.wav|2|100000|- Leave him alone!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002087.wav|2|100000|Small fucking towns.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002088.wav|2|100000|- You see him?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002089.wav|2|100000|Sorry about that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002090.wav|2|100000|- Uh, this morning.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002091.wav|2|100000|- We'll get you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002092.wav|2|100000|I have supersperm!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002093.wav|2|100000|2nd Platoon, listen up.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002094.wav|2|100000|Not this time.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002095.wav|2|100000|Yet firm too.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002096.wav|2|100000|Great distraction, man!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002098.wav|2|100000|I say we slip the message into one of the dog's collars, round up some fleas, put them on the dog.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002102.wav|2|100000|We got to stick together, until we know how to play him or until he slips up, then we get him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002107.wav|2|100000|If you wanna help the public and do your jobs best, sit quietly and listen to what I have to say.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002111.wav|2|100000|We just wanted to get married quietly, without any hoo-ha.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002112.wav|2|100000|Even if I don't know exactly what it is I do.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002113.wav|2|100000|Trouble is, Ann, when I'm standin' up my mind's lyin' down.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002114.wav|2|100000|Damn, if that don't feel like I got my balls back.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002115.wav|2|100000|All I know is that there is evil in the air..
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002116.wav|2|100000|And sooner or later we're gonna find where the money is.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002117.wav|2|100000|Mrs. Faber confessed to stabbing Rocco with her husband's knife once.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002118.wav|2|100000|You'll have to fill out a few of these forms, but...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002119.wav|2|100000|Well, my friend, all is not well on the hippie front.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002120.wav|2|100000|She's probably in black velvet with a feather in her hair.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002121.wav|2|100000|Tonight, I prefer to just dine in the shadows, thank you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002122.wav|2|100000|Sometimes the enemy of my enemy is my friend, Agent Gibbs.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002123.wav|2|100000|For not turning you back over to the marshals to hang.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002124.wav|2|100000|Just for what Master Wang has said, we are all Chinese.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002125.wav|2|100000|Um, can you call me back when you get this, please?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002126.wav|2|100000|So, is he the man of your life, or what happened?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002127.wav|2|100000|When white people see me coming into their store, they run.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002128.wav|2|100000|(GRUNTING)
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002129.wav|2|100000|Oh!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002130.wav|2|100000|Yes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002152.wav|2|100000|Venus cannot be her real name.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002153.wav|2|100000|- It was Teru Mikami's own decision...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002154.wav|2|100000|Just when we need him most.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002155.wav|2|100000|You look like you've been crying.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002156.wav|2|100000|Oh, just a spare power cell.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002157.wav|2|100000|You don't want to marry him?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002158.wav|2|100000|Bobby, you're to remember this number.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002159.wav|2|100000|No one has to die here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002160.wav|2|100000|I have an audition on Friday.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002161.wav|2|100000|# You workin' that, you trickin' that
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002162.wav|2|100000|Have fun together while I'm gone.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002163.wav|2|100000|He was only good in crafts!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002164.wav|2|100000|I am not making an accusation.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002179.wav|2|100000|He's a man, who kills when he wants to, if I want to, no power on earth can stop me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002203.wav|2|100000|No, it--it--it sounds weird, but it was totally a spur-of-the-moment thing,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002205.wav|2|100000|No, it's just, uh, she caught me at Dad's yesterday, and she really laid into me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002206.wav|2|100000|Very much what everyone...first thing that comes into their mind when they think about me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002207.wav|2|100000|I just spent more and more time at the diner, trying to make the place work.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002208.wav|2|100000|You know, you should check into Mr. Hennessey and see what he was doing last night.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002209.wav|2|100000|I think he hid it in the mineshaft, which is about a half a mile north.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002210.wav|2|100000|Do you know that for a fact, or is that just what you want to believe?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002211.wav|2|100000|Look, Chuck is my boyfriend, and he makes $12 an hour, so you stay away from him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002212.wav|2|100000|Because they definitely want me back, and I wanna be able to have the freedom to...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002213.wav|2|100000|We'll do a second line of resistance up there, on the hill, two hundred meters away.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002218.wav|2|100000|You can believe that!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002219.wav|2|100000|I'm looking for Pboo.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002220.wav|2|100000|Hayes at the plate.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002221.wav|2|100000|- Mister, you all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002222.wav|2|100000|Guys, my back hurts.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002223.wav|2|100000|What is going on?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002224.wav|2|100000|Garza's alibi checks out!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002225.wav|2|100000|No baby, come here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002226.wav|2|100000|Come watch the show.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002227.wav|2|100000|BIRTH CERTIFICATE - FATHER UNKNOWN
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002228.wav|2|100000|Let me see that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0002_002229.wav|2|100000|And then I'm frightened.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000063.wav|3|0|I just wanted you to loosen up, have a good time - lt's okay.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000064.wav|3|0|I'm just going to agitate some of your molecules and split them apart.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000065.wav|3|0|None of this would have been possible if you hadn't trusted the Cylon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000066.wav|3|100000|- Fine, once I got 'em six bags of chips and some fresh air.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000067.wav|3|100000|It's sort of the Dukes of Hazzard method of avoiding the cops, so...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000068.wav|3|100000|Because you were talking with Vincent's wife.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000069.wav|3|100000|Do you wanna punish me right now?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000070.wav|3|100000|What are you playing at this time?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000071.wav|3|100000|Forget all this is out here sometimes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000072.wav|3|100000|What did you say your name was?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000073.wav|3|100000|But really, I admire you very much.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000074.wav|3|100000|You made my sister spit at me
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000075.wav|3|100000|- I expect you to tell the truth.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000076.wav|3|100000|And what is your period, Mr. Smart?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000077.wav|3|100000|Take the room next to hers, Sonja.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000078.wav|3|100000|I've had enough excitement for one life.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000079.wav|3|100000|And poor Mary, she was so scared.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000080.wav|3|100000|- Did you use that as bait so--
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000081.wav|3|100000|I know what dengue fever is like.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000082.wav|3|100000|But break it gently she is old ...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000083.wav|3|100000|We don't make anything off that one.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000084.wav|3|100000|- some manner of harm many moons ago.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000085.wav|3|100000|Hey, o'neill, hand me a bear claw.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000086.wav|3|100000|Is impossible to keep this from Washington
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000101.wav|3|100000|What they do... is they will sit up in this higher energy state... and then drop down again.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000102.wav|3|100000|I slept with Jacob once when I had to go to his house to pick up my dogs.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000103.wav|3|100000|You know, I've been thinking, when you blew up your car back there, you blew up mine, too.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000105.wav|3|100000|I'm just going to go and talk to Daddy for a few minutes... and I'll be right back.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000107.wav|3|100000|I also built that library and used it to help a dozen guys get a high school diploma.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000108.wav|3|100000|No, that is an example of map... I've seen maps, certainly, that have my road on, for example.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000109.wav|3|100000|There are contractors that show up in pickup trucks, and they kind of watch you and surveil you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000122.wav|3|100000|Rest those little bones, while I go out and make a goddamn fool of myself.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000123.wav|3|100000|I can get you an achilles tendon in South Korea for anywhere between $200 and $1,200 dollars.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000124.wav|3|100000|- I could have a thousand years with you, and it would still be too soon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000125.wav|3|100000|What is the reason you were in the desert so close to the Mexican border?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000126.wav|3|100000|Why does everyone feel the need to have these things, these, like, symbols of adulthood?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000127.wav|3|100000|We were supposed to go to Opera House in it and conduct a big raid.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000128.wav|3|100000|I've been keeping it a secret for months, and I'm going to stop hiding it.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000129.wav|3|100000|At the end of the month, I get a bonus, 10% of anything the horses make.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000130.wav|3|100000|The other two were floating in the hotel pool, and they weren't doing the backstroke.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000131.wav|3|100000|You know, I should've just done the full nickel the first time you busted me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000132.wav|3|100000|That guy's got two heads, a foot of reach on us, and no blind spot.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000133.wav|3|100000|One's the Bible, one's a book on Christmas... one's on how to be a carpenter.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000134.wav|3|100000|The safety of every man here rests with me, Caulder, and I can't trust you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000135.wav|3|100000|The world, you see, though it appears to be expanding infinitely, is truthfully quite small.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000136.wav|3|100000|- Yeah, an adult bear was milked half a dozen times, and then killed for this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000137.wav|3|100000|lot of lost souls took shepherd's call for blood seriously-- family values at its worst.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000138.wav|3|100000|Derek, I'd like to speak with your mom for a moment, is that all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000139.wav|3|100000|I'm Taylor's mother and I was just wondering if you created a fake profile online?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000140.wav|3|100000|Every time Brandon has a blow-up it's, like, always pointed at a stronger woman.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000141.wav|3|100000|So, I told him I'd give him a quick B.J. If he laid off.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000142.wav|3|100000|"Next day it was back to life back to reality"
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000143.wav|3|100000|I object to working on this case on moral grounds.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000144.wav|3|100000|Liquid nitrogen -- I use it to freeze the body parts.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000145.wav|3|100000|Do me a favor and put your feet straight out.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000146.wav|3|100000|And what is it to you after all Miss Lister?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000147.wav|3|100000|Do me a favor, I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000148.wav|3|100000|I should get my dad a new pair of shoes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000149.wav|3|100000|Am I gonna have to hear this from you, too?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000150.wav|3|100000|Sark has demanded that you open her coffin for him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000151.wav|3|100000|Don't be so chatty, have your drink and move on.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000152.wav|3|100000|Only three motor vehicles permitted in whole of Simla, memsahib.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000153.wav|3|100000|will feel the wrath of the gods and my revenge.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000154.wav|3|100000|Why don't we just get it all out in open?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000155.wav|3|100000|- If you don't like me, let's get him someone else.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000156.wav|3|100000|Frank's not a guy that usually comes up with plans.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000157.wav|3|100000|I don't just abandon people when they leave the TARDIS.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000158.wav|3|100000|The Jews, those in the work squads, thought at first...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000159.wav|3|100000|All he done was to recommend Demetrius to the bank.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000160.wav|3|100000|What if Joan and Arthur cave to State and send her home?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000161.wav|3|100000|I think she wants me to rub olive oil on your taint.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000166.wav|3|100000|I've always been a rational man with a great faith in science.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000167.wav|3|100000|If I had a big hollywood guy like you on my team,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000168.wav|3|100000|I don't think her boyfriend was too happy about her moving out.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000169.wav|3|100000|But this incident has helped me gain a new respect for him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000170.wav|3|100000|Why did you come with a pistol and point it at Tony?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000171.wav|3|100000|I realized I knew Herbert Gelman only after I'd heard his testimony.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000172.wav|3|100000|Meaningless words... you say, as you exhale to slow down the breath.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000173.wav|3|100000|L'm here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000174.wav|3|100000|But, but...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000175.wav|3|100000|Our classmate.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000176.wav|3|100000|- What, Colette?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000177.wav|3|100000|What's wrong?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000178.wav|3|100000|(GONG SOUNDING)
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000179.wav|3|100000|Let's talk.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000191.wav|3|100000|Do you need ammo, guns?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000192.wav|3|100000|Why are you still here?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000193.wav|3|100000|His bullets untraceable of course.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000194.wav|3|100000|- First, our hosts attacked us.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000195.wav|3|100000|Your hair is so pretty.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000197.wav|3|100000|Don't lie to me, Logan.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000198.wav|3|100000|I won't show any mercy!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000199.wav|3|100000|- Not a sound all night.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000200.wav|3|100000|And you will be crushed.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000201.wav|3|100000|I've been walking for miles.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000202.wav|3|100000|Yeah. I'm glad you weren't.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000203.wav|3|100000|My wedding can suck it?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000204.wav|3|100000|This isn't the real list.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000205.wav|3|100000|I'm too fast for TV.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000206.wav|3|100000|I got these shoes here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000207.wav|3|100000|The Tysons are here waiting.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000208.wav|3|100000|- take care of everything else.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000209.wav|3|100000|Give him a fucking mustache.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000210.wav|3|100000|That's enough of that horseshit.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000211.wav|3|100000|- He gave me the explosives.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000212.wav|3|100000|You're really good at that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000213.wav|3|100000|What time is that, exactly?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000224.wav|3|100000|I asked her if she would check Alan's cellphone for any recently made calls.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000225.wav|3|100000|I'm real glad we have six months together before you have to go to...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000226.wav|3|100000|What difference does it make if my wife was in on it or not?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000227.wav|3|100000|I just want to say I'm-I'm so honored that you're-you're doing this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000229.wav|3|100000|I am falling for you, Caroline, and I'm pretty sure you feel the same.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000230.wav|3|100000|What it meant to you Was still another chance to move closer to blake.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000231.wav|3|100000|Let's go to a pet shop tomorrow and get a new cat, all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000232.wav|3|100000|You insisted that you would not be left at Casterly Rock under any circumstances.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000233.wav|3|100000|I'm really hoping that you and I can move forward with my book, Julianne.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000234.wav|3|100000|You will call an outsider in the middle of the night and tell him...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000235.wav|3|100000|I know you think you're saving your people, but you need to stop this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000236.wav|3|100000|You probably aren't the sort of person who is cut out for manipulating others.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000237.wav|3|100000|The guy hanging naked from the shower curtain rod... half dead from autoerotic asphyxiation?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000238.wav|3|100000|Well, just don't use no sticks or no knives or no piece of iron.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000239.wav|3|100000|Because now he'll have to stay with these people for a long, long time.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000240.wav|3|100000|An impairment of set-background discrimination can get you into a heap of trouble.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000241.wav|3|100000|It made you write a book about the seven steps to heal the heart?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000242.wav|3|100000|I heard that Ibaragi Doji who lives in Senjo-ga-take is a demon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000243.wav|3|100000|I cannot imagine what they will do if the cache is not returned whole.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000245.wav|3|100000|If you came to say more cruel things to me, I'm going to bed.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000264.wav|3|100000|Easy on the gin, heavy on the tonic.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000265.wav|3|100000|I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000266.wav|3|100000|Peter Jennings and Tom Brokaw have bald spots!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000267.wav|3|100000|I'm not gonna inquire about that right now.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000268.wav|3|100000|I'm only a messenger, that must be obvious.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000269.wav|3|100000|But I never stopped to think about it
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000270.wav|3|100000|Did you see the eyes on that thing?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000271.wav|3|100000|And when I look back from a distance,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000272.wav|3|100000|You have nothing to return to in Stockholm.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000273.wav|3|100000|Look, I just need a few more minutes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000274.wav|3|100000|- Don, I can't seem to access this site.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000275.wav|3|100000|Don't you think his stomach is really big?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000276.wav|3|100000|What did you want them to be, wrong?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000277.wav|3|100000|Uh, I can't believe how fat I look.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000278.wav|3|100000|I bought it at piggly wiggly for 95 cents.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000279.wav|3|100000|When they rob you, you don't take money.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000280.wav|3|100000|They killed my boy and just drove on...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000281.wav|3|100000|Are you or are you not the Messiah?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000282.wav|3|100000|It was Eva Marie Saint and Sal Mineo.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000283.wav|3|100000|So let me put this simply for you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000284.wav|3|100000|- This medicine doesn't do a bit of good.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000285.wav|3|100000|Does everyone in your business talk like that?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000286.wav|3|100000|- Leave him alone!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000287.wav|3|100000|Small fucking towns.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000288.wav|3|100000|- You see him?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000289.wav|3|100000|Sorry about that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000290.wav|3|100000|- Uh, this morning.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000291.wav|3|100000|- We'll get you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000292.wav|3|100000|I have supersperm!

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000294.wav|3|100000|Not this time.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000295.wav|3|100000|Yet firm too.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000296.wav|3|100000|Great distraction, man!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000298.wav|3|100000|I say we slip the message into one of the dog's collars, round up some fleas, put them on the dog.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000302.wav|3|100000|We got to stick together, until we know how to play him or until he slips up, then we get him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000307.wav|3|100000|If you wanna help the public and do your jobs best, sit quietly and listen to what I have to say.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000311.wav|3|100000|We just wanted to get married quietly, without any hoo-ha.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000312.wav|3|100000|Even if I don't know exactly what it is I do.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000313.wav|3|100000|Trouble is, Ann, when I'm standin' up my mind's lyin' down.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000314.wav|3|100000|Damn, if that don't feel like I got my balls back.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000315.wav|3|100000|All I know is that there is evil in the air..
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000316.wav|3|100000|And sooner or later we're gonna find where the money is.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000319.wav|3|100000|Well, my friend, all is not well on the hippie front.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000320.wav|3|100000|She's probably in black velvet with a feather in her hair.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000321.wav|3|100000|Tonight, I prefer to just dine in the shadows, thank you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000322.wav|3|100000|Sometimes the enemy of my enemy is my friend, Agent Gibbs.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000323.wav|3|100000|For not turning you back over to the marshals to hang.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000324.wav|3|100000|Just for what Master Wang has said, we are all Chinese.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000325.wav|3|100000|Um, can you call me back when you get this, please?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000326.wav|3|100000|So, is he the man of your life, or what happened?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000327.wav|3|100000|When white people see me coming into their store, they run.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000353.wav|3|100000|- It was Teru Mikami's own decision...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000354.wav|3|100000|Just when we need him most.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000355.wav|3|100000|You look like you've been crying.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000356.wav|3|100000|Oh, just a spare power cell.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000357.wav|3|100000|You don't want to marry him?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000358.wav|3|100000|Bobby, you're to remember this number.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000359.wav|3|100000|No one has to die here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000360.wav|3|100000|I have an audition on Friday.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000361.wav|3|100000|# You workin' that, you trickin' that
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000362.wav|3|100000|Have fun together while I'm gone.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000364.wav|3|100000|I am not making an accusation.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000379.wav|3|100000|He's a man, who kills when he wants to, if I want to, no power on earth can stop me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000403.wav|3|100000|No, it--it--it sounds weird, but it was totally a spur-of-the-moment thing,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000405.wav|3|100000|No, it's just, uh, she caught me at Dad's yesterday, and she really laid into me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000406.wav|3|100000|Very much what everyone...first thing that comes into their mind when they think about me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000407.wav|3|100000|I just spent more and more time at the diner, trying to make the place work.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000408.wav|3|100000|You know, you should check into Mr. Hennessey and see what he was doing last night.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000409.wav|3|100000|I think he hid it in the mineshaft, which is about a half a mile north.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000410.wav|3|100000|Do you know that for a fact, or is that just what you want to believe?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000411.wav|3|100000|Look, Chuck is my boyfriend, and he makes $12 an hour, so you stay away from him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000412.wav|3|100000|Because they definitely want me back, and I wanna be able to have the freedom to...

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000422.wav|3|100000|Guys, my back hurts.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000423.wav|3|100000|What is going on?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000424.wav|3|100000|Garza's alibi checks out!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000425.wav|3|100000|No baby, come here.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000513.wav|3|1|I just wanted you to loosen up, have a good time - lt's okay.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000514.wav|3|1|I'm just going to agitate some of your molecules and split them apart.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000516.wav|3|100000|- Fine, once I got 'em six bags of chips and some fresh air.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000517.wav|3|100000|It's sort of the Dukes of Hazzard method of avoiding the cops, so...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000518.wav|3|100000|Because you were talking with Vincent's wife.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000520.wav|3|100000|What are you playing at this time?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000521.wav|3|100000|Forget all this is out here sometimes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000522.wav|3|100000|What did you say your name was?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000523.wav|3|100000|But really, I admire you very much.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000524.wav|3|100000|You made my sister spit at me
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000525.wav|3|100000|- I expect you to tell the truth.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000526.wav|3|100000|And what is your period, Mr. Smart?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000527.wav|3|100000|Take the room next to hers, Sonja.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000528.wav|3|100000|I've had enough excitement for one life.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000529.wav|3|100000|And poor Mary, she was so scared.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000530.wav|3|100000|- Did you use that as bait so--
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000531.wav|3|100000|I know what dengue fever is like.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000532.wav|3|100000|But break it gently she is old ...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000533.wav|3|100000|We don't make anything off that one.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000534.wav|3|100000|- some manner of harm many moons ago.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000551.wav|3|100000|What they do... is they will sit up in this higher energy state... and then drop down again.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000552.wav|3|100000|I slept with Jacob once when I had to go to his house to pick up my dogs.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000553.wav|3|100000|You know, I've been thinking, when you blew up your car back there, you blew up mine, too.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000555.wav|3|100000|I'm just going to go and talk to Daddy for a few minutes... and I'll be right back.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000557.wav|3|100000|I also built that library and used it to help a dozen guys get a high school diploma.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000558.wav|3|100000|No, that is an example of map... I've seen maps, certainly, that have my road on, for example.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000559.wav|3|100000|There are contractors that show up in pickup trucks, and they kind of watch you and surveil you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000572.wav|3|100000|Rest those little bones, while I go out and make a goddamn fool of myself.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000573.wav|3|100000|I can get you an achilles tendon in South Korea for anywhere between $200 and $1,200 dollars.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000574.wav|3|100000|- I could have a thousand years with you, and it would still be too soon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000575.wav|3|100000|What is the reason you were in the desert so close to the Mexican border?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000576.wav|3|100000|Why does everyone feel the need to have these things, these, like, symbols of adulthood?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000577.wav|3|100000|We were supposed to go to Opera House in it and conduct a big raid.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000578.wav|3|100000|I've been keeping it a secret for months, and I'm going to stop hiding it.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000579.wav|3|100000|At the end of the month, I get a bonus, 10% of anything the horses make.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000580.wav|3|100000|The other two were floating in the hotel pool, and they weren't doing the backstroke.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000581.wav|3|100000|You know, I should've just done the full nickel the first time you busted me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000582.wav|3|100000|That guy's got two heads, a foot of reach on us, and no blind spot.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000583.wav|3|100000|One's the Bible, one's a book on Christmas... one's on how to be a carpenter.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000584.wav|3|100000|The safety of every man here rests with me, Caulder, and I can't trust you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000585.wav|3|100000|The world, you see, though it appears to be expanding infinitely, is truthfully quite small.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000586.wav|3|100000|- Yeah, an adult bear was milked half a dozen times, and then killed for this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000587.wav|3|100000|lot of lost souls took shepherd's call for blood seriously-- family values at its worst.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000588.wav|3|100000|Derek, I'd like to speak with your mom for a moment, is that all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000589.wav|3|100000|I'm Taylor's mother and I was just wondering if you created a fake profile online?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000590.wav|3|100000|Every time Brandon has a blow-up it's, like, always pointed at a stronger woman.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000591.wav|3|100000|So, I told him I'd give him a quick B.J. If he laid off.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000592.wav|3|100000|"Next day it was back to life back to reality"
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000593.wav|3|100000|I object to working on this case on moral grounds.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000594.wav|3|100000|Liquid nitrogen -- I use it to freeze the body parts.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000595.wav|3|100000|Do me a favor and put your feet straight out.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000596.wav|3|100000|And what is it to you after all Miss Lister?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000597.wav|3|100000|Do me a favor, I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000598.wav|3|100000|I should get my dad a new pair of shoes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000599.wav|3|100000|Am I gonna have to hear this from you, too?

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000604.wav|3|100000|Why don't we just get it all out in open?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000605.wav|3|100000|- If you don't like me, let's get him someone else.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000606.wav|3|100000|Frank's not a guy that usually comes up with plans.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000607.wav|3|100000|I don't just abandon people when they leave the TARDIS.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000608.wav|3|100000|The Jews, those in the work squads, thought at first...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000609.wav|3|100000|All he done was to recommend Demetrius to the bank.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000610.wav|3|100000|What if Joan and Arthur cave to State and send her home?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000611.wav|3|100000|I think she wants me to rub olive oil on your taint.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000612.wav|3|100000|They were yelling at him, "Mr President, we need you to act!"
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000613.wav|3|100000|Yeah, in the 1920s a cat burglar named Nigel Hubbard left no fingerprints.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000614.wav|3|100000|- My father's had that book in a drawer since I was born.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000615.wav|3|100000|The risk of unpopular decision, competition, corruption, passivity, have prevented any action.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000616.wav|3|100000|I've always been a rational man with a great faith in science.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000617.wav|3|100000|If I had a big hollywood guy like you on my team,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000618.wav|3|100000|I don't think her boyfriend was too happy about her moving out.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000619.wav|3|100000|But this incident has helped me gain a new respect for him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000620.wav|3|100000|Why did you come with a pistol and point it at Tony?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000621.wav|3|100000|I realized I knew Herbert Gelman only after I'd heard his testimony.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000622.wav|3|100000|Meaningless words... you say, as you exhale to slow down the breath.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000623.wav|3|100000|L'm here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000624.wav|3|100000|But, but...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000625.wav|3|100000|Our classmate.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000626.wav|3|100000|- What, Colette?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000627.wav|3|100000|What's wrong?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000628.wav|3|100000|(GONG SOUNDING)
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000629.wav|3|100000|Let's talk.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000641.wav|3|100000|Do you need ammo, guns?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000642.wav|3|100000|Why are you still here?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000643.wav|3|100000|His bullets untraceable of course.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000644.wav|3|100000|- First, our hosts attacked us.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000645.wav|3|100000|Your hair is so pretty.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000646.wav|3|100000|Shall we arrange this way
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000647.wav|3|100000|Don't lie to me, Logan.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000648.wav|3|100000|I won't show any mercy!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000649.wav|3|100000|- Not a sound all night.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000650.wav|3|100000|And you will be crushed.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000651.wav|3|100000|I've been walking for miles.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000652.wav|3|100000|Yeah. I'm glad you weren't.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000653.wav|3|100000|My wedding can suck it?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000654.wav|3|100000|This isn't the real list.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000655.wav|3|100000|I'm too fast for TV.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000656.wav|3|100000|I got these shoes here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000657.wav|3|100000|The Tysons are here waiting.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000658.wav|3|100000|- take care of everything else.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000659.wav|3|100000|Give him a fucking mustache.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000660.wav|3|100000|That's enough of that horseshit.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000661.wav|3|100000|- He gave me the explosives.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000662.wav|3|100000|You're really good at that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000663.wav|3|100000|What time is that, exactly?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000674.wav|3|100000|I asked her if she would check Alan's cellphone for any recently made calls.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000675.wav|3|100000|I'm real glad we have six months together before you have to go to...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000676.wav|3|100000|What difference does it make if my wife was in on it or not?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000677.wav|3|100000|I just want to say I'm-I'm so honored that you're-you're doing this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000679.wav|3|100000|I am falling for you, Caroline, and I'm pretty sure you feel the same.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000680.wav|3|100000|What it meant to you Was still another chance to move closer to blake.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000681.wav|3|100000|Let's go to a pet shop tomorrow and get a new cat, all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000682.wav|3|100000|You insisted that you would not be left at Casterly Rock under any circumstances.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000683.wav|3|100000|I'm really hoping that you and I can move forward with my book, Julianne.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000684.wav|3|100000|You will call an outsider in the middle of the night and tell him...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000685.wav|3|100000|I know you think you're saving your people, but you need to stop this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000686.wav|3|100000|You probably aren't the sort of person who is cut out for manipulating others.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000687.wav|3|100000|The guy hanging naked from the shower curtain rod... half dead from autoerotic asphyxiation?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000688.wav|3|100000|Well, just don't use no sticks or no knives or no piece of iron.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000689.wav|3|100000|Because now he'll have to stay with these people for a long, long time.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000690.wav|3|100000|An impairment of set-background discrimination can get you into a heap of trouble.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000691.wav|3|100000|It made you write a book about the seven steps to heal the heart?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000692.wav|3|100000|I heard that Ibaragi Doji who lives in Senjo-ga-take is a demon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000693.wav|3|100000|I cannot imagine what they will do if the cache is not returned whole.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000694.wav|3|100000|We would love to save your princess, but are looking for two royal geeks.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000695.wav|3|100000|If you came to say more cruel things to me, I'm going to bed.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000714.wav|3|100000|Easy on the gin, heavy on the tonic.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000715.wav|3|100000|I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000716.wav|3|100000|Peter Jennings and Tom Brokaw have bald spots!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000717.wav|3|100000|I'm not gonna inquire about that right now.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000718.wav|3|100000|I'm only a messenger, that must be obvious.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000719.wav|3|100000|But I never stopped to think about it
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000720.wav|3|100000|Did you see the eyes on that thing?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000721.wav|3|100000|And when I look back from a distance,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000722.wav|3|100000|You have nothing to return to in Stockholm.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000723.wav|3|100000|Look, I just need a few more minutes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000724.wav|3|100000|- Don, I can't seem to access this site.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000725.wav|3|100000|Don't you think his stomach is really big?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000726.wav|3|100000|What did you want them to be, wrong?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000727.wav|3|100000|Uh, I can't believe how fat I look.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000728.wav|3|100000|I bought it at piggly wiggly for 95 cents.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000729.wav|3|100000|When they rob you, you don't take money.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000730.wav|3|100000|They killed my boy and just drove on...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000731.wav|3|100000|Are you or are you not the Messiah?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000732.wav|3|100000|It was Eva Marie Saint and Sal Mineo.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000733.wav|3|100000|So let me put this simply for you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000734.wav|3|100000|- This medicine doesn't do a bit of good.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000735.wav|3|100000|Does everyone in your business talk like that?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000736.wav|3|100000|- Leave him alone!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000737.wav|3|100000|Small fucking towns.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000738.wav|3|100000|- You see him?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000739.wav|3|100000|Sorry about that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000740.wav|3|100000|- Uh, this morning.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000741.wav|3|100000|- We'll get you.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000748.wav|3|100000|I say we slip the message into one of the dog's collars, round up some fleas, put them on the dog.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000761.wav|3|100000|We just wanted to get married quietly, without any hoo-ha.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000762.wav|3|100000|Even if I don't know exactly what it is I do.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000763.wav|3|100000|Trouble is, Ann, when I'm standin' up my mind's lyin' down.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000764.wav|3|100000|Damn, if that don't feel like I got my balls back.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000765.wav|3|100000|All I know is that there is evil in the air..
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000766.wav|3|100000|And sooner or later we're gonna find where the money is.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000772.wav|3|100000|Sometimes the enemy of my enemy is my friend, Agent Gibbs.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000773.wav|3|100000|For not turning you back over to the marshals to hang.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000774.wav|3|100000|Just for what Master Wang has said, we are all Chinese.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000814.wav|3|100000|I am not making an accusation.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000829.wav|3|100000|He's a man, who kills when he wants to, if I want to, no power on earth can stop me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000853.wav|3|100000|No, it--it--it sounds weird, but it was totally a spur-of-the-moment thing,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000855.wav|3|100000|No, it's just, uh, she caught me at Dad's yesterday, and she really laid into me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000856.wav|3|100000|Very much what everyone...first thing that comes into their mind when they think about me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000857.wav|3|100000|I just spent more and more time at the diner, trying to make the place work.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000858.wav|3|100000|You know, you should check into Mr. Hennessey and see what he was doing last night.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000859.wav|3|100000|I think he hid it in the mineshaft, which is about a half a mile north.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000860.wav|3|100000|Do you know that for a fact, or is that just what you want to believe?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000861.wav|3|100000|Look, Chuck is my boyfriend, and he makes $12 an hour, so you stay away from him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000862.wav|3|100000|Because they definitely want me back, and I wanna be able to have the freedom to...

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000964.wav|3|2|I'm just going to agitate some of your molecules and split them apart.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000965.wav|3|2|None of this would have been possible if you hadn't trusted the Cylon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000966.wav|3|100000|- Fine, once I got 'em six bags of chips and some fresh air.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000967.wav|3|100000|It's sort of the Dukes of Hazzard method of avoiding the cops, so...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000968.wav|3|100000|Because you were talking with Vincent's wife.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000969.wav|3|100000|Do you wanna punish me right now?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000970.wav|3|100000|What are you playing at this time?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000971.wav|3|100000|Forget all this is out here sometimes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000972.wav|3|100000|What did you say your name was?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000973.wav|3|100000|But really, I admire you very much.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000974.wav|3|100000|You made my sister spit at me
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000975.wav|3|100000|- I expect you to tell the truth.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000976.wav|3|100000|And what is your period, Mr. Smart?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000977.wav|3|100000|Take the room next to hers, Sonja.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000978.wav|3|100000|I've had enough excitement for one life.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000979.wav|3|100000|And poor Mary, she was so scared.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000980.wav|3|100000|- Did you use that as bait so--
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000981.wav|3|100000|I know what dengue fever is like.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_000982.wav|3|100000|But break it gently she is old ...

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001002.wav|3|100000|I slept with Jacob once when I had to go to his house to pick up my dogs.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001003.wav|3|100000|You know, I've been thinking, when you blew up your car back there, you blew up mine, too.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001005.wav|3|100000|I'm just going to go and talk to Daddy for a few minutes... and I'll be right back.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001007.wav|3|100000|I also built that library and used it to help a dozen guys get a high school diploma.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001008.wav|3|100000|No, that is an example of map... I've seen maps, certainly, that have my road on, for example.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001009.wav|3|100000|There are contractors that show up in pickup trucks, and they kind of watch you and surveil you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001022.wav|3|100000|Rest those little bones, while I go out and make a goddamn fool of myself.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001025.wav|3|100000|What is the reason you were in the desert so close to the Mexican border?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001026.wav|3|100000|Why does everyone feel the need to have these things, these, like, symbols of adulthood?

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001028.wav|3|100000|I've been keeping it a secret for months, and I'm going to stop hiding it.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001029.wav|3|100000|At the end of the month, I get a bonus, 10% of anything the horses make.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001030.wav|3|100000|The other two were floating in the hotel pool, and they weren't doing the backstroke.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001031.wav|3|100000|You know, I should've just done the full nickel the first time you busted me.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001035.wav|3|100000|The world, you see, though it appears to be expanding infinitely, is truthfully quite small.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001036.wav|3|100000|- Yeah, an adult bear was milked half a dozen times, and then killed for this.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001056.wav|3|100000|Frank's not a guy that usually comes up with plans.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001057.wav|3|100000|I don't just abandon people when they leave the TARDIS.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001058.wav|3|100000|The Jews, those in the work squads, thought at first...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001059.wav|3|100000|All he done was to recommend Demetrius to the bank.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001060.wav|3|100000|What if Joan and Arthur cave to State and send her home?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001061.wav|3|100000|I think she wants me to rub olive oil on your taint.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001097.wav|3|100000|Don't lie to me, Logan.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001098.wav|3|100000|I won't show any mercy!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001099.wav|3|100000|- Not a sound all night.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001100.wav|3|100000|And you will be crushed.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001101.wav|3|100000|I've been walking for miles.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001102.wav|3|100000|Yeah. I'm glad you weren't.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001103.wav|3|100000|My wedding can suck it?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001104.wav|3|100000|This isn't the real list.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001105.wav|3|100000|I'm too fast for TV.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001106.wav|3|100000|I got these shoes here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001107.wav|3|100000|The Tysons are here waiting.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001108.wav|3|100000|- take care of everything else.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001109.wav|3|100000|Give him a fucking mustache.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001110.wav|3|100000|That's enough of that horseshit.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001111.wav|3|100000|- He gave me the explosives.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001112.wav|3|100000|You're really good at that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001113.wav|3|100000|What time is that, exactly?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001124.wav|3|100000|I asked her if she would check Alan's cellphone for any recently made calls.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001125.wav|3|100000|I'm real glad we have six months together before you have to go to...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001126.wav|3|100000|What difference does it make if my wife was in on it or not?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001127.wav|3|100000|I just want to say I'm-I'm so honored that you're-you're doing this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001129.wav|3|100000|I am falling for you, Caroline, and I'm pretty sure you feel the same.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001130.wav|3|100000|What it meant to you Was still another chance to move closer to blake.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001131.wav|3|100000|Let's go to a pet shop tomorrow and get a new cat, all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001132.wav|3|100000|You insisted that you would not be left at Casterly Rock under any circumstances.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001133.wav|3|100000|I'm really hoping that you and I can move forward with my book, Julianne.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001134.wav|3|100000|You will call an outsider in the middle of the night and tell him...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001135.wav|3|100000|I know you think you're saving your people, but you need to stop this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001136.wav|3|100000|You probably aren't the sort of person who is cut out for manipulating others.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001137.wav|3|100000|The guy hanging naked from the shower curtain rod... half dead from autoerotic asphyxiation?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001138.wav|3|100000|Well, just don't use no sticks or no knives or no piece of iron.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001139.wav|3|100000|Because now he'll have to stay with these people for a long, long time.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001140.wav|3|100000|An impairment of set-background discrimination can get you into a heap of trouble.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001141.wav|3|100000|It made you write a book about the seven steps to heal the heart?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001142.wav|3|100000|I heard that Ibaragi Doji who lives in Senjo-ga-take is a demon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001143.wav|3|100000|I cannot imagine what they will do if the cache is not returned whole.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001144.wav|3|100000|We would love to save your princess, but are looking for two royal geeks.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001145.wav|3|100000|If you came to say more cruel things to me, I'm going to bed.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001164.wav|3|100000|Easy on the gin, heavy on the tonic.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001165.wav|3|100000|I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001166.wav|3|100000|Peter Jennings and Tom Brokaw have bald spots!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001167.wav|3|100000|I'm not gonna inquire about that right now.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001168.wav|3|100000|I'm only a messenger, that must be obvious.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001169.wav|3|100000|But I never stopped to think about it
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001170.wav|3|100000|Did you see the eyes on that thing?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001171.wav|3|100000|And when I look back from a distance,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001172.wav|3|100000|You have nothing to return to in Stockholm.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001173.wav|3|100000|Look, I just need a few more minutes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001174.wav|3|100000|- Don, I can't seem to access this site.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001175.wav|3|100000|Don't you think his stomach is really big?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001176.wav|3|100000|What did you want them to be, wrong?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001177.wav|3|100000|Uh, I can't believe how fat I look.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001178.wav|3|100000|I bought it at piggly wiggly for 95 cents.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001179.wav|3|100000|When they rob you, you don't take money.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001180.wav|3|100000|They killed my boy and just drove on...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001181.wav|3|100000|Are you or are you not the Messiah?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001182.wav|3|100000|It was Eva Marie Saint and Sal Mineo.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001183.wav|3|100000|So let me put this simply for you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001184.wav|3|100000|- This medicine doesn't do a bit of good.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001185.wav|3|100000|Does everyone in your business talk like that?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001186.wav|3|100000|- Leave him alone!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001187.wav|3|100000|Small fucking towns.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001188.wav|3|100000|- You see him?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001189.wav|3|100000|Sorry about that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001190.wav|3|100000|- Uh, this morning.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001191.wav|3|100000|- We'll get you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001192.wav|3|100000|I have supersperm!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001193.wav|3|100000|2nd Platoon, listen up.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001194.wav|3|100000|Not this time.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001195.wav|3|100000|Yet firm too.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001196.wav|3|100000|Great distraction, man!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001198.wav|3|100000|I say we slip the message into one of the dog's collars, round up some fleas, put them on the dog.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001202.wav|3|100000|We got to stick together, until we know how to play him or until he slips up, then we get him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001207.wav|3|100000|If you wanna help the public and do your jobs best, sit quietly and listen to what I have to say.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001211.wav|3|100000|We just wanted to get married quietly, without any hoo-ha.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001212.wav|3|100000|Even if I don't know exactly what it is I do.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001213.wav|3|100000|Trouble is, Ann, when I'm standin' up my mind's lyin' down.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001214.wav|3|100000|Damn, if that don't feel like I got my balls back.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001215.wav|3|100000|All I know is that there is evil in the air..
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001216.wav|3|100000|And sooner or later we're gonna find where the money is.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001217.wav|3|100000|Mrs. Faber confessed to stabbing Rocco with her husband's knife once.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001218.wav|3|100000|You'll have to fill out a few of these forms, but...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001219.wav|3|100000|Well, my friend, all is not well on the hippie front.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001220.wav|3|100000|She's probably in black velvet with a feather in her hair.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001221.wav|3|100000|Tonight, I prefer to just dine in the shadows, thank you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001222.wav|3|100000|Sometimes the enemy of my enemy is my friend, Agent Gibbs.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001223.wav|3|100000|For not turning you back over to the marshals to hang.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001224.wav|3|100000|Just for what Master Wang has said, we are all Chinese.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001225.wav|3|100000|Um, can you call me back when you get this, please?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001226.wav|3|100000|So, is he the man of your life, or what happened?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001227.wav|3|100000|When white people see me coming into their store, they run.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001228.wav|3|100000|(GRUNTING)
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001229.wav|3|100000|Oh!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001230.wav|3|100000|Yes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001252.wav|3|100000|Venus cannot be her real name.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001253.wav|3|100000|- It was Teru Mikami's own decision...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001254.wav|3|100000|Just when we need him most.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001255.wav|3|100000|You look like you've been crying.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001256.wav|3|100000|Oh, just a spare power cell.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001257.wav|3|100000|You don't want to marry him?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001258.wav|3|100000|Bobby, you're to remember this number.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001259.wav|3|100000|No one has to die here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001260.wav|3|100000|I have an audition on Friday.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001261.wav|3|100000|# You workin' that, you trickin' that
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001262.wav|3|100000|Have fun together while I'm gone.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001263.wav|3|100000|He was only good in crafts!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001264.wav|3|100000|I am not making an accusation.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001279.wav|3|100000|He's a man, who kills when he wants to, if I want to, no power on earth can stop me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001303.wav|3|100000|No, it--it--it sounds weird, but it was totally a spur-of-the-moment thing,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001305.wav|3|100000|No, it's just, uh, she caught me at Dad's yesterday, and she really laid into me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001306.wav|3|100000|Very much what everyone...first thing that comes into their mind when they think about me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001307.wav|3|100000|I just spent more and more time at the diner, trying to make the place work.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001308.wav|3|100000|You know, you should check into Mr. Hennessey and see what he was doing last night.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001309.wav|3|100000|I think he hid it in the mineshaft, which is about a half a mile north.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001310.wav|3|100000|Do you know that for a fact, or is that just what you want to believe?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001311.wav|3|100000|Look, Chuck is my boyfriend, and he makes $12 an hour, so you stay away from him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001312.wav|3|100000|Because they definitely want me back, and I wanna be able to have the freedom to...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001313.wav|3|100000|We'll do a second line of resistance up there, on the hill, two hundred meters away.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001318.wav|3|100000|You can believe that!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001319.wav|3|100000|I'm looking for Pboo.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001320.wav|3|100000|Hayes at the plate.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001321.wav|3|100000|- Mister, you all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001322.wav|3|100000|Guys, my back hurts.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001323.wav|3|100000|What is going on?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001324.wav|3|100000|Garza's alibi checks out!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001325.wav|3|100000|No baby, come here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001326.wav|3|100000|Come watch the show.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001327.wav|3|100000|BIRTH CERTIFICATE - FATHER UNKNOWN
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001328.wav|3|100000|Let me see that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001329.wav|3|100000|And then I'm frightened.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001413.wav|3|3|I just wanted you to loosen up, have a good time - lt's okay.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001414.wav|3|3|I'm just going to agitate some of your molecules and split them apart.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001415.wav|3|3|None of this would have been possible if you hadn't trusted the Cylon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001416.wav|3|100000|- Fine, once I got 'em six bags of chips and some fresh air.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001417.wav|3|100000|It's sort of the Dukes of Hazzard method of avoiding the cops, so...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001418.wav|3|100000|Because you were talking with Vincent's wife.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001419.wav|3|100000|Do you wanna punish me right now?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001420.wav|3|100000|What are you playing at this time?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001421.wav|3|100000|Forget all this is out here sometimes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001422.wav|3|100000|What did you say your name was?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001423.wav|3|100000|But really, I admire you very much.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001424.wav|3|100000|You made my sister spit at me
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001425.wav|3|100000|- I expect you to tell the truth.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001426.wav|3|100000|And what is your period, Mr. Smart?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001427.wav|3|100000|Take the room next to hers, Sonja.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001428.wav|3|100000|I've had enough excitement for one life.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001429.wav|3|100000|And poor Mary, she was so scared.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001430.wav|3|100000|- Did you use that as bait so--
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001431.wav|3|100000|I know what dengue fever is like.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001432.wav|3|100000|But break it gently she is old ...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001433.wav|3|100000|We don't make anything off that one.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001434.wav|3|100000|- some manner of harm many moons ago.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001435.wav|3|100000|Hey, o'neill, hand me a bear claw.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001436.wav|3|100000|Is impossible to keep this from Washington
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001451.wav|3|100000|What they do... is they will sit up in this higher energy state... and then drop down again.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001452.wav|3|100000|I slept with Jacob once when I had to go to his house to pick up my dogs.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001453.wav|3|100000|You know, I've been thinking, when you blew up your car back there, you blew up mine, too.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001675.wav|3|100000|Um, can you call me back when you get this, please?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001676.wav|3|100000|So, is he the man of your life, or what happened?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001677.wav|3|100000|When white people see me coming into their store, they run.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001678.wav|3|100000|(GRUNTING)
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001679.wav|3|100000|Oh!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001680.wav|3|100000|Yes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001702.wav|3|100000|Venus cannot be her real name.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001703.wav|3|100000|- It was Teru Mikami's own decision...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001704.wav|3|100000|Just when we need him most.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001705.wav|3|100000|You look like you've been crying.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001706.wav|3|100000|Oh, just a spare power cell.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001707.wav|3|100000|You don't want to marry him?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001708.wav|3|100000|Bobby, you're to remember this number.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001709.wav|3|100000|No one has to die here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001710.wav|3|100000|I have an audition on Friday.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001711.wav|3|100000|# You workin' that, you trickin' that
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001712.wav|3|100000|Have fun together while I'm gone.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001713.wav|3|100000|He was only good in crafts!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001714.wav|3|100000|I am not making an accusation.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001729.wav|3|100000|He's a man, who kills when he wants to, if I want to, no power on earth can stop me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001753.wav|3|100000|No, it--it--it sounds weird, but it was totally a spur-of-the-moment thing,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001755.wav|3|100000|No, it's just, uh, she caught me at Dad's yesterday, and she really laid into me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001756.wav|3|100000|Very much what everyone...first thing that comes into their mind when they think about me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001757.wav|3|100000|I just spent more and more time at the diner, trying to make the place work.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001758.wav|3|100000|You know, you should check into Mr. Hennessey and see what he was doing last night.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001759.wav|3|100000|I think he hid it in the mineshaft, which is about a half a mile north.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001760.wav|3|100000|Do you know that for a fact, or is that just what you want to believe?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001761.wav|3|100000|Look, Chuck is my boyfriend, and he makes $12 an hour, so you stay away from him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001762.wav|3|100000|Because they definitely want me back, and I wanna be able to have the freedom to...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001763.wav|3|100000|We'll do a second line of resistance up there, on the hill, two hundred meters away.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001768.wav|3|100000|You can believe that!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001769.wav|3|100000|I'm looking for Pboo.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001770.wav|3|100000|Hayes at the plate.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001771.wav|3|100000|- Mister, you all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001772.wav|3|100000|Guys, my back hurts.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001773.wav|3|100000|What is going on?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001774.wav|3|100000|Garza's alibi checks out!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001775.wav|3|100000|No baby, come here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001776.wav|3|100000|Come watch the show.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001777.wav|3|100000|BIRTH CERTIFICATE - FATHER UNKNOWN
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001778.wav|3|100000|Let me see that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001779.wav|3|100000|And then I'm frightened.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001863.wav|3|4|I just wanted you to loosen up, have a good time - lt's okay.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001864.wav|3|4|I'm just going to agitate some of your molecules and split them apart.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001865.wav|3|4|None of this would have been possible if you hadn't trusted the Cylon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001866.wav|3|100000|- Fine, once I got 'em six bags of chips and some fresh air.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001867.wav|3|100000|It's sort of the Dukes of Hazzard method of avoiding the cops, so...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001868.wav|3|100000|Because you were talking with Vincent's wife.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001869.wav|3|100000|Do you wanna punish me right now?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001870.wav|3|100000|What are you playing at this time?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001871.wav|3|100000|Forget all this is out here sometimes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001872.wav|3|100000|What did you say your name was?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001873.wav|3|100000|But really, I admire you very much.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001874.wav|3|100000|You made my sister spit at me
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001875.wav|3|100000|- I expect you to tell the truth.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001876.wav|3|100000|And what is your period, Mr. Smart?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001877.wav|3|100000|Take the room next to hers, Sonja.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001878.wav|3|100000|I've had enough excitement for one life.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001879.wav|3|100000|And poor Mary, she was so scared.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001880.wav|3|100000|- Did you use that as bait so--
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001881.wav|3|100000|I know what dengue fever is like.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001882.wav|3|100000|But break it gently she is old ...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001883.wav|3|100000|We don't make anything off that one.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001884.wav|3|100000|- some manner of harm many moons ago.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001885.wav|3|100000|Hey, o'neill, hand me a bear claw.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001886.wav|3|100000|Is impossible to keep this from Washington
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001901.wav|3|100000|What they do... is they will sit up in this higher energy state... and then drop down again.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001902.wav|3|100000|I slept with Jacob once when I had to go to his house to pick up my dogs.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001903.wav|3|100000|You know, I've been thinking, when you blew up your car back there, you blew up mine, too.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001905.wav|3|100000|I'm just going to go and talk to Daddy for a few minutes... and I'll be right back.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001907.wav|3|100000|I also built that library and used it to help a dozen guys get a high school diploma.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001908.wav|3|100000|No, that is an example of map... I've seen maps, certainly, that have my road on, for example.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001909.wav|3|100000|There are contractors that show up in pickup trucks, and they kind of watch you and surveil you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001922.wav|3|100000|Rest those little bones, while I go out and make a goddamn fool of myself.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001923.wav|3|100000|I can get you an achilles tendon in South Korea for anywhere between $200 and $1,200 dollars.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001924.wav|3|100000|- I could have a thousand years with you, and it would still be too soon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001925.wav|3|100000|What is the reason you were in the desert so close to the Mexican border?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001926.wav|3|100000|Why does everyone feel the need to have these things, these, like, symbols of adulthood?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001927.wav|3|100000|We were supposed to go to Opera House in it and conduct a big raid.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001928.wav|3|100000|I've been keeping it a secret for months, and I'm going to stop hiding it.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001929.wav|3|100000|At the end of the month, I get a bonus, 10% of anything the horses make.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001930.wav|3|100000|The other two were floating in the hotel pool, and they weren't doing the backstroke.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001931.wav|3|100000|You know, I should've just done the full nickel the first time you busted me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001932.wav|3|100000|That guy's got two heads, a foot of reach on us, and no blind spot.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001933.wav|3|100000|One's the Bible, one's a book on Christmas... one's on how to be a carpenter.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001934.wav|3|100000|The safety of every man here rests with me, Caulder, and I can't trust you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001935.wav|3|100000|The world, you see, though it appears to be expanding infinitely, is truthfully quite small.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001936.wav|3|100000|- Yeah, an adult bear was milked half a dozen times, and then killed for this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001937.wav|3|100000|lot of lost souls took shepherd's call for blood seriously-- family values at its worst.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001938.wav|3|100000|Derek, I'd like to speak with your mom for a moment, is that all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001939.wav|3|100000|I'm Taylor's mother and I was just wondering if you created a fake profile online?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001940.wav|3|100000|Every time Brandon has a blow-up it's, like, always pointed at a stronger woman.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001941.wav|3|100000|So, I told him I'd give him a quick B.J. If he laid off.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001942.wav|3|100000|"Next day it was back to life back to reality"
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001943.wav|3|100000|I object to working on this case on moral grounds.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001944.wav|3|100000|Liquid nitrogen -- I use it to freeze the body parts.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001945.wav|3|100000|Do me a favor and put your feet straight out.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001946.wav|3|100000|And what is it to you after all Miss Lister?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001947.wav|3|100000|Do me a favor, I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001948.wav|3|100000|I should get my dad a new pair of shoes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001949.wav|3|100000|Am I gonna have to hear this from you, too?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001950.wav|3|100000|Sark has demanded that you open her coffin for him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001951.wav|3|100000|Don't be so chatty, have your drink and move on.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001954.wav|3|100000|Why don't we just get it all out in open?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001955.wav|3|100000|- If you don't like me, let's get him someone else.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001956.wav|3|100000|Frank's not a guy that usually comes up with plans.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001957.wav|3|100000|I don't just abandon people when they leave the TARDIS.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001958.wav|3|100000|The Jews, those in the work squads, thought at first...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001959.wav|3|100000|All he done was to recommend Demetrius to the bank.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001960.wav|3|100000|What if Joan and Arthur cave to State and send her home?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001961.wav|3|100000|I think she wants me to rub olive oil on your taint.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001962.wav|3|100000|They were yelling at him, "Mr President, we need you to act!"
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001963.wav|3|100000|Yeah, in the 1920s a cat burglar named Nigel Hubbard left no fingerprints.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001964.wav|3|100000|- My father's had that book in a drawer since I was born.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001965.wav|3|100000|The risk of unpopular decision, competition, corruption, passivity, have prevented any action.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001967.wav|3|100000|If I had a big hollywood guy like you on my team,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001968.wav|3|100000|I don't think her boyfriend was too happy about her moving out.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001969.wav|3|100000|But this incident has helped me gain a new respect for him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001970.wav|3|100000|Why did you come with a pistol and point it at Tony?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001971.wav|3|100000|I realized I knew Herbert Gelman only after I'd heard his testimony.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001972.wav|3|100000|Meaningless words... you say, as you exhale to slow down the breath.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001973.wav|3|100000|L'm here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001974.wav|3|100000|But, but...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001975.wav|3|100000|Our classmate.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001976.wav|3|100000|- What, Colette?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001977.wav|3|100000|What's wrong?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001978.wav|3|100000|(GONG SOUNDING)
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001979.wav|3|100000|Let's talk.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001991.wav|3|100000|Do you need ammo, guns?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001992.wav|3|100000|Why are you still here?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001993.wav|3|100000|His bullets untraceable of course.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001994.wav|3|100000|- First, our hosts attacked us.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001995.wav|3|100000|Your hair is so pretty.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001996.wav|3|100000|Shall we arrange this way
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001997.wav|3|100000|Don't lie to me, Logan.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_001998.wav|3|100000|I won't show any mercy!

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002000.wav|3|100000|And you will be crushed.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002001.wav|3|100000|I've been walking for miles.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002002.wav|3|100000|Yeah. I'm glad you weren't.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002003.wav|3|100000|My wedding can suck it?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002004.wav|3|100000|This isn't the real list.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002005.wav|3|100000|I'm too fast for TV.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002006.wav|3|100000|I got these shoes here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002007.wav|3|100000|The Tysons are here waiting.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002008.wav|3|100000|- take care of everything else.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002009.wav|3|100000|Give him a fucking mustache.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002010.wav|3|100000|That's enough of that horseshit.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002011.wav|3|100000|- He gave me the explosives.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002012.wav|3|100000|You're really good at that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002013.wav|3|100000|What time is that, exactly?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002024.wav|3|100000|I asked her if she would check Alan's cellphone for any recently made calls.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002025.wav|3|100000|I'm real glad we have six months together before you have to go to...

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002027.wav|3|100000|I just want to say I'm-I'm so honored that you're-you're doing this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002029.wav|3|100000|I am falling for you, Caroline, and I'm pretty sure you feel the same.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002030.wav|3|100000|What it meant to you Was still another chance to move closer to blake.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002031.wav|3|100000|Let's go to a pet shop tomorrow and get a new cat, all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002032.wav|3|100000|You insisted that you would not be left at Casterly Rock under any circumstances.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002033.wav|3|100000|I'm really hoping that you and I can move forward with my book, Julianne.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002034.wav|3|100000|You will call an outsider in the middle of the night and tell him...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002035.wav|3|100000|I know you think you're saving your people, but you need to stop this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002036.wav|3|100000|You probably aren't the sort of person who is cut out for manipulating others.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002037.wav|3|100000|The guy hanging naked from the shower curtain rod... half dead from autoerotic asphyxiation?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002038.wav|3|100000|Well, just don't use no sticks or no knives or no piece of iron.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002039.wav|3|100000|Because now he'll have to stay with these people for a long, long time.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002040.wav|3|100000|An impairment of set-background discrimination can get you into a heap of trouble.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002041.wav|3|100000|It made you write a book about the seven steps to heal the heart?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002042.wav|3|100000|I heard that Ibaragi Doji who lives in Senjo-ga-take is a demon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002043.wav|3|100000|I cannot imagine what they will do if the cache is not returned whole.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002044.wav|3|100000|We would love to save your princess, but are looking for two royal geeks.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002045.wav|3|100000|If you came to say more cruel things to me, I'm going to bed.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002064.wav|3|100000|Easy on the gin, heavy on the tonic.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002065.wav|3|100000|I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002066.wav|3|100000|Peter Jennings and Tom Brokaw have bald spots!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002067.wav|3|100000|I'm not gonna inquire about that right now.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002068.wav|3|100000|I'm only a messenger, that must be obvious.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002069.wav|3|100000|But I never stopped to think about it
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002070.wav|3|100000|Did you see the eyes on that thing?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002071.wav|3|100000|And when I look back from a distance,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002072.wav|3|100000|You have nothing to return to in Stockholm.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002073.wav|3|100000|Look, I just need a few more minutes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002074.wav|3|100000|- Don, I can't seem to access this site.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002075.wav|3|100000|Don't you think his stomach is really big?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002076.wav|3|100000|What did you want them to be, wrong?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002077.wav|3|100000|Uh, I can't believe how fat I look.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002078.wav|3|100000|I bought it at piggly wiggly for 95 cents.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002079.wav|3|100000|When they rob you, you don't take money.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002080.wav|3|100000|They killed my boy and just drove on...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002081.wav|3|100000|Are you or are you not the Messiah?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002082.wav|3|100000|It was Eva Marie Saint and Sal Mineo.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002083.wav|3|100000|So let me put this simply for you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002084.wav|3|100000|- This medicine doesn't do a bit of good.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002085.wav|3|100000|Does everyone in your business talk like that?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002086.wav|3|100000|- Leave him alone!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002087.wav|3|100000|Small fucking towns.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002088.wav|3|100000|- You see him?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002089.wav|3|100000|Sorry about that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002090.wav|3|100000|- Uh, this morning.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002091.wav|3|100000|- We'll get you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002092.wav|3|100000|I have supersperm!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002093.wav|3|100000|2nd Platoon, listen up.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002094.wav|3|100000|Not this time.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002095.wav|3|100000|Yet firm too.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002096.wav|3|100000|Great distraction, man!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002098.wav|3|100000|I say we slip the message into one of the dog's collars, round up some fleas, put them on the dog.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002102.wav|3|100000|We got to stick together, until we know how to play him or until he slips up, then we get him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002107.wav|3|100000|If you wanna help the public and do your jobs best, sit quietly and listen to what I have to say.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002111.wav|3|100000|We just wanted to get married quietly, without any hoo-ha.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002112.wav|3|100000|Even if I don't know exactly what it is I do.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002113.wav|3|100000|Trouble is, Ann, when I'm standin' up my mind's lyin' down.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002114.wav|3|100000|Damn, if that don't feel like I got my balls back.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002115.wav|3|100000|All I know is that there is evil in the air..
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002116.wav|3|100000|And sooner or later we're gonna find where the money is.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002117.wav|3|100000|Mrs. Faber confessed to stabbing Rocco with her husband's knife once.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002118.wav|3|100000|You'll have to fill out a few of these forms, but...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002119.wav|3|100000|Well, my friend, all is not well on the hippie front.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002120.wav|3|100000|She's probably in black velvet with a feather in her hair.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002121.wav|3|100000|Tonight, I prefer to just dine in the shadows, thank you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002122.wav|3|100000|Sometimes the enemy of my enemy is my friend, Agent Gibbs.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002123.wav|3|100000|For not turning you back over to the marshals to hang.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002124.wav|3|100000|Just for what Master Wang has said, we are all Chinese.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002125.wav|3|100000|Um, can you call me back when you get this, please?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002126.wav|3|100000|So, is he the man of your life, or what happened?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002127.wav|3|100000|When white people see me coming into their store, they run.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002128.wav|3|100000|(GRUNTING)
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002129.wav|3|100000|Oh!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002130.wav|3|100000|Yes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002152.wav|3|100000|Venus cannot be her real name.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002153.wav|3|100000|- It was Teru Mikami's own decision...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002154.wav|3|100000|Just when we need him most.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002155.wav|3|100000|You look like you've been crying.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002156.wav|3|100000|Oh, just a spare power cell.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002157.wav|3|100000|You don't want to marry him?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002158.wav|3|100000|Bobby, you're to remember this number.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002159.wav|3|100000|No one has to die here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002160.wav|3|100000|I have an audition on Friday.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002161.wav|3|100000|# You workin' that, you trickin' that
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002162.wav|3|100000|Have fun together while I'm gone.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002163.wav|3|100000|He was only good in crafts!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002164.wav|3|100000|I am not making an accusation.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002179.wav|3|100000|He's a man, who kills when he wants to, if I want to, no power on earth can stop me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002203.wav|3|100000|No, it--it--it sounds weird, but it was totally a spur-of-the-moment thing,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002205.wav|3|100000|No, it's just, uh, she caught me at Dad's yesterday, and she really laid into me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002206.wav|3|100000|Very much what everyone...first thing that comes into their mind when they think about me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002207.wav|3|100000|I just spent more and more time at the diner, trying to make the place work.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002208.wav|3|100000|You know, you should check into Mr. Hennessey and see what he was doing last night.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002209.wav|3|100000|I think he hid it in the mineshaft, which is about a half a mile north.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002210.wav|3|100000|Do you know that for a fact, or is that just what you want to believe?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002211.wav|3|100000|Look, Chuck is my boyfriend, and he makes $12 an hour, so you stay away from him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002212.wav|3|100000|Because they definitely want me back, and I wanna be able to have the freedom to...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002213.wav|3|100000|We'll do a second line of resistance up there, on the hill, two hundred meters away.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002218.wav|3|100000|You can believe that!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002219.wav|3|100000|I'm looking for Pboo.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002220.wav|3|100000|Hayes at the plate.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002221.wav|3|100000|- Mister, you all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002222.wav|3|100000|Guys, my back hurts.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002223.wav|3|100000|What is going on?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002224.wav|3|100000|Garza's alibi checks out!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002225.wav|3|100000|No baby, come here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002226.wav|3|100000|Come watch the show.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002227.wav|3|100000|BIRTH CERTIFICATE - FATHER UNKNOWN
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002228.wav|3|100000|Let me see that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0003_002229.wav|3|100000|And then I'm frightened.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000063.wav|4|0|I just wanted you to loosen up, have a good time - lt's okay.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000064.wav|4|0|I'm just going to agitate some of your molecules and split them apart.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000065.wav|4|0|None of this would have been possible if you hadn't trusted the Cylon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000066.wav|4|100000|- Fine, once I got 'em six bags of chips and some fresh air.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000067.wav|4|100000|It's sort of the Dukes of Hazzard method of avoiding the cops, so...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000068.wav|4|100000|Because you were talking with Vincent's wife.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000069.wav|4|100000|Do you wanna punish me right now?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000070.wav|4|100000|What are you playing at this time?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000071.wav|4|100000|Forget all this is out here sometimes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000072.wav|4|100000|What did you say your name was?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000073.wav|4|100000|But really, I admire you very much.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000074.wav|4|100000|You made my sister spit at me
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000075.wav|4|100000|- I expect you to tell the truth.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000076.wav|4|100000|And what is your period, Mr. Smart?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000077.wav|4|100000|Take the room next to hers, Sonja.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000078.wav|4|100000|I've had enough excitement for one life.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000079.wav|4|100000|And poor Mary, she was so scared.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000080.wav|4|100000|- Did you use that as bait so--
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000081.wav|4|100000|I know what dengue fever is like.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000082.wav|4|100000|But break it gently she is old ...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000083.wav|4|100000|We don't make anything off that one.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000084.wav|4|100000|- some manner of harm many moons ago.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000085.wav|4|100000|Hey, o'neill, hand me a bear claw.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000086.wav|4|100000|Is impossible to keep this from Washington
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000101.wav|4|100000|What they do... is they will sit up in this higher energy state... and then drop down again.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000102.wav|4|100000|I slept with Jacob once when I had to go to his house to pick up my dogs.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000103.wav|4|100000|You know, I've been thinking, when you blew up your car back there, you blew up mine, too.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000105.wav|4|100000|I'm just going to go and talk to Daddy for a few minutes... and I'll be right back.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000107.wav|4|100000|I also built that library and used it to help a dozen guys get a high school diploma.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000108.wav|4|100000|No, that is an example of map... I've seen maps, certainly, that have my road on, for example.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000109.wav|4|100000|There are contractors that show up in pickup trucks, and they kind of watch you and surveil you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000122.wav|4|100000|Rest those little bones, while I go out and make a goddamn fool of myself.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000123.wav|4|100000|I can get you an achilles tendon in South Korea for anywhere between $200 and $1,200 dollars.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000124.wav|4|100000|- I could have a thousand years with you, and it would still be too soon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000125.wav|4|100000|What is the reason you were in the desert so close to the Mexican border?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000126.wav|4|100000|Why does everyone feel the need to have these things, these, like, symbols of adulthood?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000127.wav|4|100000|We were supposed to go to Opera House in it and conduct a big raid.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000128.wav|4|100000|I've been keeping it a secret for months, and I'm going to stop hiding it.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000129.wav|4|100000|At the end of the month, I get a bonus, 10% of anything the horses make.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000130.wav|4|100000|The other two were floating in the hotel pool, and they weren't doing the backstroke.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000131.wav|4|100000|You know, I should've just done the full nickel the first time you busted me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000132.wav|4|100000|That guy's got two heads, a foot of reach on us, and no blind spot.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000133.wav|4|100000|One's the Bible, one's a book on Christmas... one's on how to be a carpenter.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000134.wav|4|100000|The safety of every man here rests with me, Caulder, and I can't trust you.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000715.wav|4|100000|I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000716.wav|4|100000|Peter Jennings and Tom Brokaw have bald spots!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000717.wav|4|100000|I'm not gonna inquire about that right now.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000718.wav|4|100000|I'm only a messenger, that must be obvious.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000719.wav|4|100000|But I never stopped to think about it
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000720.wav|4|100000|Did you see the eyes on that thing?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000721.wav|4|100000|And when I look back from a distance,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000722.wav|4|100000|You have nothing to return to in Stockholm.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000723.wav|4|100000|Look, I just need a few more minutes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000724.wav|4|100000|- Don, I can't seem to access this site.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000726.wav|4|100000|What did you want them to be, wrong?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000727.wav|4|100000|Uh, I can't believe how fat I look.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000728.wav|4|100000|I bought it at piggly wiggly for 95 cents.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000729.wav|4|100000|When they rob you, you don't take money.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000730.wav|4|100000|They killed my boy and just drove on...

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000732.wav|4|100000|It was Eva Marie Saint and Sal Mineo.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000733.wav|4|100000|So let me put this simply for you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000734.wav|4|100000|- This medicine doesn't do a bit of good.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000735.wav|4|100000|Does everyone in your business talk like that?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000736.wav|4|100000|- Leave him alone!

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000738.wav|4|100000|- You see him?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000739.wav|4|100000|Sorry about that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000740.wav|4|100000|- Uh, this morning.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000741.wav|4|100000|- We'll get you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000742.wav|4|100000|I have supersperm!

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000744.wav|4|100000|Not this time.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000745.wav|4|100000|Yet firm too.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000746.wav|4|100000|Great distraction, man!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000748.wav|4|100000|I say we slip the message into one of the dog's collars, round up some fleas, put them on the dog.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000752.wav|4|100000|We got to stick together, until we know how to play him or until he slips up, then we get him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000757.wav|4|100000|If you wanna help the public and do your jobs best, sit quietly and listen to what I have to say.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000761.wav|4|100000|We just wanted to get married quietly, without any hoo-ha.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000762.wav|4|100000|Even if I don't know exactly what it is I do.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000763.wav|4|100000|Trouble is, Ann, when I'm standin' up my mind's lyin' down.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000764.wav|4|100000|Damn, if that don't feel like I got my balls back.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000765.wav|4|100000|All I know is that there is evil in the air..
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000766.wav|4|100000|And sooner or later we're gonna find where the money is.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000769.wav|4|100000|Well, my friend, all is not well on the hippie front.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000770.wav|4|100000|She's probably in black velvet with a feather in her hair.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000771.wav|4|100000|Tonight, I prefer to just dine in the shadows, thank you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000772.wav|4|100000|Sometimes the enemy of my enemy is my friend, Agent Gibbs.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000773.wav|4|100000|For not turning you back over to the marshals to hang.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000774.wav|4|100000|Just for what Master Wang has said, we are all Chinese.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000775.wav|4|100000|Um, can you call me back when you get this, please?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000776.wav|4|100000|So, is he the man of your life, or what happened?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000777.wav|4|100000|When white people see me coming into their store, they run.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000780.wav|4|100000|Yes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000802.wav|4|100000|Venus cannot be her real name.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000803.wav|4|100000|- It was Teru Mikami's own decision...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000804.wav|4|100000|Just when we need him most.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000805.wav|4|100000|You look like you've been crying.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000806.wav|4|100000|Oh, just a spare power cell.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000807.wav|4|100000|You don't want to marry him?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000808.wav|4|100000|Bobby, you're to remember this number.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000809.wav|4|100000|No one has to die here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000810.wav|4|100000|I have an audition on Friday.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000811.wav|4|100000|# You workin' that, you trickin' that
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000812.wav|4|100000|Have fun together while I'm gone.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000813.wav|4|100000|He was only good in crafts!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000814.wav|4|100000|I am not making an accusation.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000829.wav|4|100000|He's a man, who kills when he wants to, if I want to, no power on earth can stop me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000853.wav|4|100000|No, it--it--it sounds weird, but it was totally a spur-of-the-moment thing,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000855.wav|4|100000|No, it's just, uh, she caught me at Dad's yesterday, and she really laid into me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000856.wav|4|100000|Very much what everyone...first thing that comes into their mind when they think about me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000857.wav|4|100000|I just spent more and more time at the diner, trying to make the place work.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000858.wav|4|100000|You know, you should check into Mr. Hennessey and see what he was doing last night.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000859.wav|4|100000|I think he hid it in the mineshaft, which is about a half a mile north.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000860.wav|4|100000|Do you know that for a fact, or is that just what you want to believe?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000861.wav|4|100000|Look, Chuck is my boyfriend, and he makes $12 an hour, so you stay away from him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000862.wav|4|100000|Because they definitely want me back, and I wanna be able to have the freedom to...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000863.wav|4|100000|We'll do a second line of resistance up there, on the hill, two hundred meters away.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000868.wav|4|100000|You can believe that!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000869.wav|4|100000|I'm looking for Pboo.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000870.wav|4|100000|Hayes at the plate.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000871.wav|4|100000|- Mister, you all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000872.wav|4|100000|Guys, my back hurts.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000873.wav|4|100000|What is going on?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000874.wav|4|100000|Garza's alibi checks out!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000875.wav|4|100000|No baby, come here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000876.wav|4|100000|Come watch the show.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000877.wav|4|100000|BIRTH CERTIFICATE - FATHER UNKNOWN
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000878.wav|4|100000|Let me see that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000879.wav|4|100000|And then I'm frightened.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000963.wav|4|2|I just wanted you to loosen up, have a good time - lt's okay.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000964.wav|4|2|I'm just going to agitate some of your molecules and split them apart.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000965.wav|4|2|None of this would have been possible if you hadn't trusted the Cylon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000966.wav|4|100000|- Fine, once I got 'em six bags of chips and some fresh air.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000967.wav|4|100000|It's sort of the Dukes of Hazzard method of avoiding the cops, so...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000968.wav|4|100000|Because you were talking with Vincent's wife.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000969.wav|4|100000|Do you wanna punish me right now?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000970.wav|4|100000|What are you playing at this time?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000971.wav|4|100000|Forget all this is out here sometimes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000972.wav|4|100000|What did you say your name was?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000973.wav|4|100000|But really, I admire you very much.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000974.wav|4|100000|You made my sister spit at me
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000975.wav|4|100000|- I expect you to tell the truth.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000976.wav|4|100000|And what is your period, Mr. Smart?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000977.wav|4|100000|Take the room next to hers, Sonja.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000978.wav|4|100000|I've had enough excitement for one life.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000979.wav|4|100000|And poor Mary, she was so scared.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000980.wav|4|100000|- Did you use that as bait so--
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000981.wav|4|100000|I know what dengue fever is like.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000982.wav|4|100000|But break it gently she is old ...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000983.wav|4|100000|We don't make anything off that one.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000984.wav|4|100000|- some manner of harm many moons ago.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000985.wav|4|100000|Hey, o'neill, hand me a bear claw.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_000986.wav|4|100000|Is impossible to keep this from Washington
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001001.wav|4|100000|What they do... is they will sit up in this higher energy state... and then drop down again.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001002.wav|4|100000|I slept with Jacob once when I had to go to his house to pick up my dogs.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001003.wav|4|100000|You know, I've been thinking, when you blew up your car back there, you blew up mine, too.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001005.wav|4|100000|I'm just going to go and talk to Daddy for a few minutes... and I'll be right back.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001007.wav|4|100000|I also built that library and used it to help a dozen guys get a high school diploma.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001008.wav|4|100000|No, that is an example of map... I've seen maps, certainly, that have my road on, for example.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001009.wav|4|100000|There are contractors that show up in pickup trucks, and they kind of watch you and surveil you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001022.wav|4|100000|Rest those little bones, while I go out and make a goddamn fool of myself.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001023.wav|4|100000|I can get you an achilles tendon in South Korea for anywhere between $200 and $1,200 dollars.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001024.wav|4|100000|- I could have a thousand years with you, and it would still be too soon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001025.wav|4|100000|What is the reason you were in the desert so close to the Mexican border?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001026.wav|4|100000|Why does everyone feel the need to have these things, these, like, symbols of adulthood?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001027.wav|4|100000|We were supposed to go to Opera House in it and conduct a big raid.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001028.wav|4|100000|I've been keeping it a secret for months, and I'm going to stop hiding it.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001029.wav|4|100000|At the end of the month, I get a bonus, 10% of anything the horses make.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001030.wav|4|100000|The other two were floating in the hotel pool, and they weren't doing the backstroke.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001031.wav|4|100000|You know, I should've just done the full nickel the first time you busted me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001032.wav|4|100000|That guy's got two heads, a foot of reach on us, and no blind spot.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001033.wav|4|100000|One's the Bible, one's a book on Christmas... one's on how to be a carpenter.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001034.wav|4|100000|The safety of every man here rests with me, Caulder, and I can't trust you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001035.wav|4|100000|The world, you see, though it appears to be expanding infinitely, is truthfully quite small.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001036.wav|4|100000|- Yeah, an adult bear was milked half a dozen times, and then killed for this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001037.wav|4|100000|lot of lost souls took shepherd's call for blood seriously-- family values at its worst.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001038.wav|4|100000|Derek, I'd like to speak with your mom for a moment, is that all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001039.wav|4|100000|I'm Taylor's mother and I was just wondering if you created a fake profile online?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001040.wav|4|100000|Every time Brandon has a blow-up it's, like, always pointed at a stronger woman.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001041.wav|4|100000|So, I told him I'd give him a quick B.J. If he laid off.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001042.wav|4|100000|"Next day it was back to life back to reality"
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001043.wav|4|100000|I object to working on this case on moral grounds.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001047.wav|4|100000|Do me a favor, I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001048.wav|4|100000|I should get my dad a new pair of shoes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001049.wav|4|100000|Am I gonna have to hear this from you, too?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001050.wav|4|100000|Sark has demanded that you open her coffin for him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001051.wav|4|100000|Don't be so chatty, have your drink and move on.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001054.wav|4|100000|Why don't we just get it all out in open?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001055.wav|4|100000|- If you don't like me, let's get him someone else.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001056.wav|4|100000|Frank's not a guy that usually comes up with plans.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001057.wav|4|100000|I don't just abandon people when they leave the TARDIS.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001058.wav|4|100000|The Jews, those in the work squads, thought at first...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001059.wav|4|100000|All he done was to recommend Demetrius to the bank.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001060.wav|4|100000|What if Joan and Arthur cave to State and send her home?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001061.wav|4|100000|I think she wants me to rub olive oil on your taint.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001062.wav|4|100000|They were yelling at him, "Mr President, we need you to act!"
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001063.wav|4|100000|Yeah, in the 1920s a cat burglar named Nigel Hubbard left no fingerprints.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001064.wav|4|100000|- My father's had that book in a drawer since I was born.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001065.wav|4|100000|The risk of unpopular decision, competition, corruption, passivity, have prevented any action.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001066.wav|4|100000|I've always been a rational man with a great faith in science.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001067.wav|4|100000|If I had a big hollywood guy like you on my team,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001068.wav|4|100000|I don't think her boyfriend was too happy about her moving out.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001069.wav|4|100000|But this incident has helped me gain a new respect for him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001070.wav|4|100000|Why did you come with a pistol and point it at Tony?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001071.wav|4|100000|I realized I knew Herbert Gelman only after I'd heard his testimony.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001072.wav|4|100000|Meaningless words... you say, as you exhale to slow down the breath.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001073.wav|4|100000|L'm here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001074.wav|4|100000|But, but...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001075.wav|4|100000|Our classmate.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001076.wav|4|100000|- What, Colette?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001077.wav|4|100000|What's wrong?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001078.wav|4|100000|(GONG SOUNDING)
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001079.wav|4|100000|Let's talk.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001091.wav|4|100000|Do you need ammo, guns?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001092.wav|4|100000|Why are you still here?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001093.wav|4|100000|His bullets untraceable of course.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001094.wav|4|100000|- First, our hosts attacked us.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001095.wav|4|100000|Your hair is so pretty.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001096.wav|4|100000|Shall we arrange this way
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001097.wav|4|100000|Don't lie to me, Logan.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001098.wav|4|100000|I won't show any mercy!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001099.wav|4|100000|- Not a sound all night.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001100.wav|4|100000|And you will be crushed.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001101.wav|4|100000|I've been walking for miles.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001102.wav|4|100000|Yeah. I'm glad you weren't.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001103.wav|4|100000|My wedding can suck it?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001104.wav|4|100000|This isn't the real list.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001105.wav|4|100000|I'm too fast for TV.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001106.wav|4|100000|I got these shoes here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001107.wav|4|100000|The Tysons are here waiting.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001108.wav|4|100000|- take care of everything else.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001109.wav|4|100000|Give him a fucking mustache.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001110.wav|4|100000|That's enough of that horseshit.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001111.wav|4|100000|- He gave me the explosives.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001112.wav|4|100000|You're really good at that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001113.wav|4|100000|What time is that, exactly?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001124.wav|4|100000|I asked her if she would check Alan's cellphone for any recently made calls.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001125.wav|4|100000|I'm real glad we have six months together before you have to go to...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001126.wav|4|100000|What difference does it make if my wife was in on it or not?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001127.wav|4|100000|I just want to say I'm-I'm so honored that you're-you're doing this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001129.wav|4|100000|I am falling for you, Caroline, and I'm pretty sure you feel the same.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001130.wav|4|100000|What it meant to you Was still another chance to move closer to blake.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001131.wav|4|100000|Let's go to a pet shop tomorrow and get a new cat, all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001132.wav|4|100000|You insisted that you would not be left at Casterly Rock under any circumstances.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001133.wav|4|100000|I'm really hoping that you and I can move forward with my book, Julianne.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001134.wav|4|100000|You will call an outsider in the middle of the night and tell him...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001135.wav|4|100000|I know you think you're saving your people, but you need to stop this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001136.wav|4|100000|You probably aren't the sort of person who is cut out for manipulating others.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001137.wav|4|100000|The guy hanging naked from the shower curtain rod... half dead from autoerotic asphyxiation?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001138.wav|4|100000|Well, just don't use no sticks or no knives or no piece of iron.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001139.wav|4|100000|Because now he'll have to stay with these people for a long, long time.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001140.wav|4|100000|An impairment of set-background discrimination can get you into a heap of trouble.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001141.wav|4|100000|It made you write a book about the seven steps to heal the heart?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001142.wav|4|100000|I heard that Ibaragi Doji who lives in Senjo-ga-take is a demon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001143.wav|4|100000|I cannot imagine what they will do if the cache is not returned whole.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001144.wav|4|100000|We would love to save your princess, but are looking for two royal geeks.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001145.wav|4|100000|If you came to say more cruel things to me, I'm going to bed.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001164.wav|4|100000|Easy on the gin, heavy on the tonic.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001165.wav|4|100000|I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001166.wav|4|100000|Peter Jennings and Tom Brokaw have bald spots!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001167.wav|4|100000|I'm not gonna inquire about that right now.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001168.wav|4|100000|I'm only a messenger, that must be obvious.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001169.wav|4|100000|But I never stopped to think about it
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001170.wav|4|100000|Did you see the eyes on that thing?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001171.wav|4|100000|And when I look back from a distance,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001172.wav|4|100000|You have nothing to return to in Stockholm.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001173.wav|4|100000|Look, I just need a few more minutes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001174.wav|4|100000|- Don, I can't seem to access this site.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001175.wav|4|100000|Don't you think his stomach is really big?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001176.wav|4|100000|What did you want them to be, wrong?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001177.wav|4|100000|Uh, I can't believe how fat I look.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001178.wav|4|100000|I bought it at piggly wiggly for 95 cents.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001179.wav|4|100000|When they rob you, you don't take money.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001180.wav|4|100000|They killed my boy and just drove on...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001181.wav|4|100000|Are you or are you not the Messiah?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001182.wav|4|100000|It was Eva Marie Saint and Sal Mineo.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001183.wav|4|100000|So let me put this simply for you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001184.wav|4|100000|- This medicine doesn't do a bit of good.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001185.wav|4|100000|Does everyone in your business talk like that?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001186.wav|4|100000|- Leave him alone!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001187.wav|4|100000|Small fucking towns.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001188.wav|4|100000|- You see him?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001189.wav|4|100000|Sorry about that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001190.wav|4|100000|- Uh, this morning.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001191.wav|4|100000|- We'll get you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001192.wav|4|100000|I have supersperm!

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001194.wav|4|100000|Not this time.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001195.wav|4|100000|Yet firm too.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001196.wav|4|100000|Great distraction, man!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001198.wav|4|100000|I say we slip the message into one of the dog's collars, round up some fleas, put them on the dog.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001202.wav|4|100000|We got to stick together, until we know how to play him or until he slips up, then we get him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001207.wav|4|100000|If you wanna help the public and do your jobs best, sit quietly and listen to what I have to say.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001211.wav|4|100000|We just wanted to get married quietly, without any hoo-ha.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001212.wav|4|100000|Even if I don't know exactly what it is I do.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001213.wav|4|100000|Trouble is, Ann, when I'm standin' up my mind's lyin' down.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001214.wav|4|100000|Damn, if that don't feel like I got my balls back.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001215.wav|4|100000|All I know is that there is evil in the air..
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001216.wav|4|100000|And sooner or later we're gonna find where the money is.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001219.wav|4|100000|Well, my friend, all is not well on the hippie front.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001220.wav|4|100000|She's probably in black velvet with a feather in her hair.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001221.wav|4|100000|Tonight, I prefer to just dine in the shadows, thank you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001222.wav|4|100000|Sometimes the enemy of my enemy is my friend, Agent Gibbs.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001223.wav|4|100000|For not turning you back over to the marshals to hang.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001224.wav|4|100000|Just for what Master Wang has said, we are all Chinese.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001225.wav|4|100000|Um, can you call me back when you get this, please?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001226.wav|4|100000|So, is he the man of your life, or what happened?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001227.wav|4|100000|When white people see me coming into their store, they run.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001254.wav|4|100000|Just when we need him most.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001255.wav|4|100000|You look like you've been crying.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001256.wav|4|100000|Oh, just a spare power cell.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001259.wav|4|100000|No one has to die here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001260.wav|4|100000|I have an audition on Friday.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001264.wav|4|100000|I am not making an accusation.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001279.wav|4|100000|He's a man, who kills when he wants to, if I want to, no power on earth can stop me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001303.wav|4|100000|No, it--it--it sounds weird, but it was totally a spur-of-the-moment thing,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001305.wav|4|100000|No, it's just, uh, she caught me at Dad's yesterday, and she really laid into me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001306.wav|4|100000|Very much what everyone...first thing that comes into their mind when they think about me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001307.wav|4|100000|I just spent more and more time at the diner, trying to make the place work.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001308.wav|4|100000|You know, you should check into Mr. Hennessey and see what he was doing last night.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001309.wav|4|100000|I think he hid it in the mineshaft, which is about a half a mile north.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001310.wav|4|100000|Do you know that for a fact, or is that just what you want to believe?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001311.wav|4|100000|Look, Chuck is my boyfriend, and he makes $12 an hour, so you stay away from him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001312.wav|4|100000|Because they definitely want me back, and I wanna be able to have the freedom to...

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001413.wav|4|3|I just wanted you to loosen up, have a good time - lt's okay.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001414.wav|4|3|I'm just going to agitate some of your molecules and split them apart.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001415.wav|4|3|None of this would have been possible if you hadn't trusted the Cylon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001416.wav|4|100000|- Fine, once I got 'em six bags of chips and some fresh air.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001417.wav|4|100000|It's sort of the Dukes of Hazzard method of avoiding the cops, so...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001418.wav|4|100000|Because you were talking with Vincent's wife.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001419.wav|4|100000|Do you wanna punish me right now?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001420.wav|4|100000|What are you playing at this time?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001421.wav|4|100000|Forget all this is out here sometimes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001422.wav|4|100000|What did you say your name was?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001423.wav|4|100000|But really, I admire you very much.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001424.wav|4|100000|You made my sister spit at me
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001425.wav|4|100000|- I expect you to tell the truth.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001426.wav|4|100000|And what is your period, Mr. Smart?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001427.wav|4|100000|Take the room next to hers, Sonja.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001428.wav|4|100000|I've had enough excitement for one life.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001429.wav|4|100000|And poor Mary, she was so scared.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001430.wav|4|100000|- Did you use that as bait so--
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001431.wav|4|100000|I know what dengue fever is like.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001432.wav|4|100000|But break it gently she is old ...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001433.wav|4|100000|We don't make anything off that one.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001434.wav|4|100000|- some manner of harm many moons ago.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001452.wav|4|100000|I slept with Jacob once when I had to go to his house to pick up my dogs.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001453.wav|4|100000|You know, I've been thinking, when you blew up your car back there, you blew up mine, too.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001455.wav|4|100000|I'm just going to go and talk to Daddy for a few minutes... and I'll be right back.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001457.wav|4|100000|I also built that library and used it to help a dozen guys get a high school diploma.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001458.wav|4|100000|No, that is an example of map... I've seen maps, certainly, that have my road on, for example.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001459.wav|4|100000|There are contractors that show up in pickup trucks, and they kind of watch you and surveil you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001472.wav|4|100000|Rest those little bones, while I go out and make a goddamn fool of myself.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001474.wav|4|100000|- I could have a thousand years with you, and it would still be too soon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001475.wav|4|100000|What is the reason you were in the desert so close to the Mexican border?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001476.wav|4|100000|Why does everyone feel the need to have these things, these, like, symbols of adulthood?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001477.wav|4|100000|We were supposed to go to Opera House in it and conduct a big raid.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001478.wav|4|100000|I've been keeping it a secret for months, and I'm going to stop hiding it.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001479.wav|4|100000|At the end of the month, I get a bonus, 10% of anything the horses make.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001480.wav|4|100000|The other two were floating in the hotel pool, and they weren't doing the backstroke.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001481.wav|4|100000|You know, I should've just done the full nickel the first time you busted me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001482.wav|4|100000|That guy's got two heads, a foot of reach on us, and no blind spot.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001483.wav|4|100000|One's the Bible, one's a book on Christmas... one's on how to be a carpenter.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001484.wav|4|100000|The safety of every man here rests with me, Caulder, and I can't trust you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001485.wav|4|100000|The world, you see, though it appears to be expanding infinitely, is truthfully quite small.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001486.wav|4|100000|- Yeah, an adult bear was milked half a dozen times, and then killed for this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001487.wav|4|100000|lot of lost souls took shepherd's call for blood seriously-- family values at its worst.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001488.wav|4|100000|Derek, I'd like to speak with your mom for a moment, is that all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001489.wav|4|100000|I'm Taylor's mother and I was just wondering if you created a fake profile online?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001490.wav|4|100000|Every time Brandon has a blow-up it's, like, always pointed at a stronger woman.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001491.wav|4|100000|So, I told him I'd give him a quick B.J. If he laid off.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001492.wav|4|100000|"Next day it was back to life back to reality"
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001493.wav|4|100000|I object to working on this case on moral grounds.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001494.wav|4|100000|Liquid nitrogen -- I use it to freeze the body parts.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001496.wav|4|100000|And what is it to you after all Miss Lister?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001497.wav|4|100000|Do me a favor, I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001499.wav|4|100000|Am I gonna have to hear this from you, too?

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001504.wav|4|100000|Why don't we just get it all out in open?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001505.wav|4|100000|- If you don't like me, let's get him someone else.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001506.wav|4|100000|Frank's not a guy that usually comes up with plans.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001507.wav|4|100000|I don't just abandon people when they leave the TARDIS.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001508.wav|4|100000|The Jews, those in the work squads, thought at first...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001509.wav|4|100000|All he done was to recommend Demetrius to the bank.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001510.wav|4|100000|What if Joan and Arthur cave to State and send her home?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001511.wav|4|100000|I think she wants me to rub olive oil on your taint.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001512.wav|4|100000|They were yelling at him, "Mr President, we need you to act!"
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001513.wav|4|100000|Yeah, in the 1920s a cat burglar named Nigel Hubbard left no fingerprints.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001514.wav|4|100000|- My father's had that book in a drawer since I was born.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001515.wav|4|100000|The risk of unpopular decision, competition, corruption, passivity, have prevented any action.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001516.wav|4|100000|I've always been a rational man with a great faith in science.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001517.wav|4|100000|If I had a big hollywood guy like you on my team,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001518.wav|4|100000|I don't think her boyfriend was too happy about her moving out.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001519.wav|4|100000|But this incident has helped me gain a new respect for him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001520.wav|4|100000|Why did you come with a pistol and point it at Tony?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001521.wav|4|100000|I realized I knew Herbert Gelman only after I'd heard his testimony.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001522.wav|4|100000|Meaningless words... you say, as you exhale to slow down the breath.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001523.wav|4|100000|L'm here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001524.wav|4|100000|But, but...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001525.wav|4|100000|Our classmate.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001526.wav|4|100000|- What, Colette?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001527.wav|4|100000|What's wrong?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001528.wav|4|100000|(GONG SOUNDING)
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001529.wav|4|100000|Let's talk.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001541.wav|4|100000|Do you need ammo, guns?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001542.wav|4|100000|Why are you still here?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001543.wav|4|100000|His bullets untraceable of course.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001544.wav|4|100000|- First, our hosts attacked us.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001545.wav|4|100000|Your hair is so pretty.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001546.wav|4|100000|Shall we arrange this way
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001547.wav|4|100000|Don't lie to me, Logan.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001548.wav|4|100000|I won't show any mercy!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001549.wav|4|100000|- Not a sound all night.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001550.wav|4|100000|And you will be crushed.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001551.wav|4|100000|I've been walking for miles.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001552.wav|4|100000|Yeah. I'm glad you weren't.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001553.wav|4|100000|My wedding can suck it?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001554.wav|4|100000|This isn't the real list.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001555.wav|4|100000|I'm too fast for TV.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001556.wav|4|100000|I got these shoes here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001557.wav|4|100000|The Tysons are here waiting.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001558.wav|4|100000|- take care of everything else.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001559.wav|4|100000|Give him a fucking mustache.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001560.wav|4|100000|That's enough of that horseshit.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001561.wav|4|100000|- He gave me the explosives.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001562.wav|4|100000|You're really good at that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001563.wav|4|100000|What time is that, exactly?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001574.wav|4|100000|I asked her if she would check Alan's cellphone for any recently made calls.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001575.wav|4|100000|I'm real glad we have six months together before you have to go to...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001576.wav|4|100000|What difference does it make if my wife was in on it or not?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001577.wav|4|100000|I just want to say I'm-I'm so honored that you're-you're doing this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001579.wav|4|100000|I am falling for you, Caroline, and I'm pretty sure you feel the same.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001580.wav|4|100000|What it meant to you Was still another chance to move closer to blake.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001581.wav|4|100000|Let's go to a pet shop tomorrow and get a new cat, all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001582.wav|4|100000|You insisted that you would not be left at Casterly Rock under any circumstances.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001583.wav|4|100000|I'm really hoping that you and I can move forward with my book, Julianne.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001584.wav|4|100000|You will call an outsider in the middle of the night and tell him...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001585.wav|4|100000|I know you think you're saving your people, but you need to stop this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001586.wav|4|100000|You probably aren't the sort of person who is cut out for manipulating others.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001587.wav|4|100000|The guy hanging naked from the shower curtain rod... half dead from autoerotic asphyxiation?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001588.wav|4|100000|Well, just don't use no sticks or no knives or no piece of iron.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001589.wav|4|100000|Because now he'll have to stay with these people for a long, long time.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001590.wav|4|100000|An impairment of set-background discrimination can get you into a heap of trouble.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001591.wav|4|100000|It made you write a book about the seven steps to heal the heart?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001592.wav|4|100000|I heard that Ibaragi Doji who lives in Senjo-ga-take is a demon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001593.wav|4|100000|I cannot imagine what they will do if the cache is not returned whole.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001594.wav|4|100000|We would love to save your princess, but are looking for two royal geeks.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001595.wav|4|100000|If you came to say more cruel things to me, I'm going to bed.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001614.wav|4|100000|Easy on the gin, heavy on the tonic.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001615.wav|4|100000|I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001616.wav|4|100000|Peter Jennings and Tom Brokaw have bald spots!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001617.wav|4|100000|I'm not gonna inquire about that right now.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001618.wav|4|100000|I'm only a messenger, that must be obvious.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001619.wav|4|100000|But I never stopped to think about it
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001620.wav|4|100000|Did you see the eyes on that thing?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001621.wav|4|100000|And when I look back from a distance,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001622.wav|4|100000|You have nothing to return to in Stockholm.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001623.wav|4|100000|Look, I just need a few more minutes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001624.wav|4|100000|- Don, I can't seem to access this site.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001625.wav|4|100000|Don't you think his stomach is really big?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001626.wav|4|100000|What did you want them to be, wrong?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001627.wav|4|100000|Uh, I can't believe how fat I look.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001628.wav|4|100000|I bought it at piggly wiggly for 95 cents.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001629.wav|4|100000|When they rob you, you don't take money.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001630.wav|4|100000|They killed my boy and just drove on...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001631.wav|4|100000|Are you or are you not the Messiah?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001632.wav|4|100000|It was Eva Marie Saint and Sal Mineo.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001633.wav|4|100000|So let me put this simply for you.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001635.wav|4|100000|Does everyone in your business talk like that?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001636.wav|4|100000|- Leave him alone!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001637.wav|4|100000|Small fucking towns.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001638.wav|4|100000|- You see him?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001639.wav|4|100000|Sorry about that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001640.wav|4|100000|- Uh, this morning.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001641.wav|4|100000|- We'll get you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001642.wav|4|100000|I have supersperm!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001643.wav|4|100000|2nd Platoon, listen up.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001644.wav|4|100000|Not this time.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001645.wav|4|100000|Yet firm too.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001646.wav|4|100000|Great distraction, man!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001648.wav|4|100000|I say we slip the message into one of the dog's collars, round up some fleas, put them on the dog.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001652.wav|4|100000|We got to stick together, until we know how to play him or until he slips up, then we get him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001657.wav|4|100000|If you wanna help the public and do your jobs best, sit quietly and listen to what I have to say.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001661.wav|4|100000|We just wanted to get married quietly, without any hoo-ha.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001662.wav|4|100000|Even if I don't know exactly what it is I do.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001663.wav|4|100000|Trouble is, Ann, when I'm standin' up my mind's lyin' down.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001664.wav|4|100000|Damn, if that don't feel like I got my balls back.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001665.wav|4|100000|All I know is that there is evil in the air..
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001666.wav|4|100000|And sooner or later we're gonna find where the money is.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001667.wav|4|100000|Mrs. Faber confessed to stabbing Rocco with her husband's knife once.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001668.wav|4|100000|You'll have to fill out a few of these forms, but...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001669.wav|4|100000|Well, my friend, all is not well on the hippie front.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001670.wav|4|100000|She's probably in black velvet with a feather in her hair.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001671.wav|4|100000|Tonight, I prefer to just dine in the shadows, thank you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001672.wav|4|100000|Sometimes the enemy of my enemy is my friend, Agent Gibbs.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001673.wav|4|100000|For not turning you back over to the marshals to hang.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001674.wav|4|100000|Just for what Master Wang has said, we are all Chinese.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001675.wav|4|100000|Um, can you call me back when you get this, please?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001676.wav|4|100000|So, is he the man of your life, or what happened?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001677.wav|4|100000|When white people see me coming into their store, they run.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001678.wav|4|100000|(GRUNTING)
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001679.wav|4|100000|Oh!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001680.wav|4|100000|Yes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001702.wav|4|100000|Venus cannot be her real name.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001703.wav|4|100000|- It was Teru Mikami's own decision...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001704.wav|4|100000|Just when we need him most.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001705.wav|4|100000|You look like you've been crying.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001706.wav|4|100000|Oh, just a spare power cell.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001707.wav|4|100000|You don't want to marry him?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001708.wav|4|100000|Bobby, you're to remember this number.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001709.wav|4|100000|No one has to die here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001710.wav|4|100000|I have an audition on Friday.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001711.wav|4|100000|# You workin' that, you trickin' that
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001712.wav|4|100000|Have fun together while I'm gone.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001713.wav|4|100000|He was only good in crafts!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001714.wav|4|100000|I am not making an accusation.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001729.wav|4|100000|He's a man, who kills when he wants to, if I want to, no power on earth can stop me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001753.wav|4|100000|No, it--it--it sounds weird, but it was totally a spur-of-the-moment thing,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001755.wav|4|100000|No, it's just, uh, she caught me at Dad's yesterday, and she really laid into me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001756.wav|4|100000|Very much what everyone...first thing that comes into their mind when they think about me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001757.wav|4|100000|I just spent more and more time at the diner, trying to make the place work.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001758.wav|4|100000|You know, you should check into Mr. Hennessey and see what he was doing last night.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001759.wav|4|100000|I think he hid it in the mineshaft, which is about a half a mile north.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001760.wav|4|100000|Do you know that for a fact, or is that just what you want to believe?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001761.wav|4|100000|Look, Chuck is my boyfriend, and he makes $12 an hour, so you stay away from him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001762.wav|4|100000|Because they definitely want me back, and I wanna be able to have the freedom to...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001763.wav|4|100000|We'll do a second line of resistance up there, on the hill, two hundred meters away.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001768.wav|4|100000|You can believe that!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001769.wav|4|100000|I'm looking for Pboo.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001770.wav|4|100000|Hayes at the plate.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001771.wav|4|100000|- Mister, you all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001772.wav|4|100000|Guys, my back hurts.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001773.wav|4|100000|What is going on?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001774.wav|4|100000|Garza's alibi checks out!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001775.wav|4|100000|No baby, come here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001776.wav|4|100000|Come watch the show.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001777.wav|4|100000|BIRTH CERTIFICATE - FATHER UNKNOWN
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001778.wav|4|100000|Let me see that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001779.wav|4|100000|And then I'm frightened.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001863.wav|4|4|I just wanted you to loosen up, have a good time - lt's okay.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001864.wav|4|4|I'm just going to agitate some of your molecules and split them apart.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001865.wav|4|4|None of this would have been possible if you hadn't trusted the Cylon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001866.wav|4|100000|- Fine, once I got 'em six bags of chips and some fresh air.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001867.wav|4|100000|It's sort of the Dukes of Hazzard method of avoiding the cops, so...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001868.wav|4|100000|Because you were talking with Vincent's wife.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001869.wav|4|100000|Do you wanna punish me right now?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001870.wav|4|100000|What are you playing at this time?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001871.wav|4|100000|Forget all this is out here sometimes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001872.wav|4|100000|What did you say your name was?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001873.wav|4|100000|But really, I admire you very much.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001874.wav|4|100000|You made my sister spit at me
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001875.wav|4|100000|- I expect you to tell the truth.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001876.wav|4|100000|And what is your period, Mr. Smart?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001877.wav|4|100000|Take the room next to hers, Sonja.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001878.wav|4|100000|I've had enough excitement for one life.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001879.wav|4|100000|And poor Mary, she was so scared.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001880.wav|4|100000|- Did you use that as bait so--
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001881.wav|4|100000|I know what dengue fever is like.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001882.wav|4|100000|But break it gently she is old ...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001883.wav|4|100000|We don't make anything off that one.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001884.wav|4|100000|- some manner of harm many moons ago.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001885.wav|4|100000|Hey, o'neill, hand me a bear claw.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001886.wav|4|100000|Is impossible to keep this from Washington
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001901.wav|4|100000|What they do... is they will sit up in this higher energy state... and then drop down again.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001902.wav|4|100000|I slept with Jacob once when I had to go to his house to pick up my dogs.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001903.wav|4|100000|You know, I've been thinking, when you blew up your car back there, you blew up mine, too.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001905.wav|4|100000|I'm just going to go and talk to Daddy for a few minutes... and I'll be right back.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001907.wav|4|100000|I also built that library and used it to help a dozen guys get a high school diploma.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001908.wav|4|100000|No, that is an example of map... I've seen maps, certainly, that have my road on, for example.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001909.wav|4|100000|There are contractors that show up in pickup trucks, and they kind of watch you and surveil you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001922.wav|4|100000|Rest those little bones, while I go out and make a goddamn fool of myself.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001923.wav|4|100000|I can get you an achilles tendon in South Korea for anywhere between $200 and $1,200 dollars.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001924.wav|4|100000|- I could have a thousand years with you, and it would still be too soon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001925.wav|4|100000|What is the reason you were in the desert so close to the Mexican border?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001926.wav|4|100000|Why does everyone feel the need to have these things, these, like, symbols of adulthood?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001927.wav|4|100000|We were supposed to go to Opera House in it and conduct a big raid.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001928.wav|4|100000|I've been keeping it a secret for months, and I'm going to stop hiding it.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001929.wav|4|100000|At the end of the month, I get a bonus, 10% of anything the horses make.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001930.wav|4|100000|The other two were floating in the hotel pool, and they weren't doing the backstroke.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001931.wav|4|100000|You know, I should've just done the full nickel the first time you busted me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001932.wav|4|100000|That guy's got two heads, a foot of reach on us, and no blind spot.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001933.wav|4|100000|One's the Bible, one's a book on Christmas... one's on how to be a carpenter.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001934.wav|4|100000|The safety of every man here rests with me, Caulder, and I can't trust you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001935.wav|4|100000|The world, you see, though it appears to be expanding infinitely, is truthfully quite small.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001936.wav|4|100000|- Yeah, an adult bear was milked half a dozen times, and then killed for this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001937.wav|4|100000|lot of lost souls took shepherd's call for blood seriously-- family values at its worst.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001938.wav|4|100000|Derek, I'd like to speak with your mom for a moment, is that all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001939.wav|4|100000|I'm Taylor's mother and I was just wondering if you created a fake profile online?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001940.wav|4|100000|Every time Brandon has a blow-up it's, like, always pointed at a stronger woman.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001941.wav|4|100000|So, I told him I'd give him a quick B.J. If he laid off.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001942.wav|4|100000|"Next day it was back to life back to reality"
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001943.wav|4|100000|I object to working on this case on moral grounds.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001944.wav|4|100000|Liquid nitrogen -- I use it to freeze the body parts.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001945.wav|4|100000|Do me a favor and put your feet straight out.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001946.wav|4|100000|And what is it to you after all Miss Lister?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001947.wav|4|100000|Do me a favor, I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001948.wav|4|100000|I should get my dad a new pair of shoes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001949.wav|4|100000|Am I gonna have to hear this from you, too?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001950.wav|4|100000|Sark has demanded that you open her coffin for him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001951.wav|4|100000|Don't be so chatty, have your drink and move on.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001952.wav|4|100000|Only three motor vehicles permitted in whole of Simla, memsahib.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001953.wav|4|100000|will feel the wrath of the gods and my revenge.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001954.wav|4|100000|Why don't we just get it all out in open?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001955.wav|4|100000|- If you don't like me, let's get him someone else.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001956.wav|4|100000|Frank's not a guy that usually comes up with plans.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001957.wav|4|100000|I don't just abandon people when they leave the TARDIS.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001958.wav|4|100000|The Jews, those in the work squads, thought at first...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001959.wav|4|100000|All he done was to recommend Demetrius to the bank.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001960.wav|4|100000|What if Joan and Arthur cave to State and send her home?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001961.wav|4|100000|I think she wants me to rub olive oil on your taint.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001962.wav|4|100000|They were yelling at him, "Mr President, we need you to act!"
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001963.wav|4|100000|Yeah, in the 1920s a cat burglar named Nigel Hubbard left no fingerprints.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001964.wav|4|100000|- My father's had that book in a drawer since I was born.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001965.wav|4|100000|The risk of unpopular decision, competition, corruption, passivity, have prevented any action.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001966.wav|4|100000|I've always been a rational man with a great faith in science.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001967.wav|4|100000|If I had a big hollywood guy like you on my team,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001968.wav|4|100000|I don't think her boyfriend was too happy about her moving out.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001969.wav|4|100000|But this incident has helped me gain a new respect for him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001970.wav|4|100000|Why did you come with a pistol and point it at Tony?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001971.wav|4|100000|I realized I knew Herbert Gelman only after I'd heard his testimony.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001972.wav|4|100000|Meaningless words... you say, as you exhale to slow down the breath.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001973.wav|4|100000|L'm here.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001975.wav|4|100000|Our classmate.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001976.wav|4|100000|- What, Colette?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001977.wav|4|100000|What's wrong?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001978.wav|4|100000|(GONG SOUNDING)
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001979.wav|4|100000|Let's talk.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001991.wav|4|100000|Do you need ammo, guns?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001992.wav|4|100000|Why are you still here?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001993.wav|4|100000|His bullets untraceable of course.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001994.wav|4|100000|- First, our hosts attacked us.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001995.wav|4|100000|Your hair is so pretty.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001996.wav|4|100000|Shall we arrange this way
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001997.wav|4|100000|Don't lie to me, Logan.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001998.wav|4|100000|I won't show any mercy!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_001999.wav|4|100000|- Not a sound all night.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002000.wav|4|100000|And you will be crushed.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002001.wav|4|100000|I've been walking for miles.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002002.wav|4|100000|Yeah. I'm glad you weren't.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002003.wav|4|100000|My wedding can suck it?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002004.wav|4|100000|This isn't the real list.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002005.wav|4|100000|I'm too fast for TV.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002006.wav|4|100000|I got these shoes here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002007.wav|4|100000|The Tysons are here waiting.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002008.wav|4|100000|- take care of everything else.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002009.wav|4|100000|Give him a fucking mustache.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002010.wav|4|100000|That's enough of that horseshit.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002011.wav|4|100000|- He gave me the explosives.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002012.wav|4|100000|You're really good at that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002013.wav|4|100000|What time is that, exactly?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002024.wav|4|100000|I asked her if she would check Alan's cellphone for any recently made calls.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002025.wav|4|100000|I'm real glad we have six months together before you have to go to...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002026.wav|4|100000|What difference does it make if my wife was in on it or not?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002027.wav|4|100000|I just want to say I'm-I'm so honored that you're-you're doing this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002029.wav|4|100000|I am falling for you, Caroline, and I'm pretty sure you feel the same.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002030.wav|4|100000|What it meant to you Was still another chance to move closer to blake.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002031.wav|4|100000|Let's go to a pet shop tomorrow and get a new cat, all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002032.wav|4|100000|You insisted that you would not be left at Casterly Rock under any circumstances.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002033.wav|4|100000|I'm really hoping that you and I can move forward with my book, Julianne.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002034.wav|4|100000|You will call an outsider in the middle of the night and tell him...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002035.wav|4|100000|I know you think you're saving your people, but you need to stop this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002036.wav|4|100000|You probably aren't the sort of person who is cut out for manipulating others.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002037.wav|4|100000|The guy hanging naked from the shower curtain rod... half dead from autoerotic asphyxiation?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002038.wav|4|100000|Well, just don't use no sticks or no knives or no piece of iron.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002039.wav|4|100000|Because now he'll have to stay with these people for a long, long time.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002040.wav|4|100000|An impairment of set-background discrimination can get you into a heap of trouble.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002041.wav|4|100000|It made you write a book about the seven steps to heal the heart?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002042.wav|4|100000|I heard that Ibaragi Doji who lives in Senjo-ga-take is a demon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002043.wav|4|100000|I cannot imagine what they will do if the cache is not returned whole.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002044.wav|4|100000|We would love to save your princess, but are looking for two royal geeks.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002045.wav|4|100000|If you came to say more cruel things to me, I'm going to bed.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002064.wav|4|100000|Easy on the gin, heavy on the tonic.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002065.wav|4|100000|I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002066.wav|4|100000|Peter Jennings and Tom Brokaw have bald spots!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002067.wav|4|100000|I'm not gonna inquire about that right now.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002068.wav|4|100000|I'm only a messenger, that must be obvious.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002069.wav|4|100000|But I never stopped to think about it
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002070.wav|4|100000|Did you see the eyes on that thing?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002071.wav|4|100000|And when I look back from a distance,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002072.wav|4|100000|You have nothing to return to in Stockholm.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002073.wav|4|100000|Look, I just need a few more minutes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002074.wav|4|100000|- Don, I can't seem to access this site.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002075.wav|4|100000|Don't you think his stomach is really big?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002076.wav|4|100000|What did you want them to be, wrong?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002077.wav|4|100000|Uh, I can't believe how fat I look.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002078.wav|4|100000|I bought it at piggly wiggly for 95 cents.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002079.wav|4|100000|When they rob you, you don't take money.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002080.wav|4|100000|They killed my boy and just drove on...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002081.wav|4|100000|Are you or are you not the Messiah?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002082.wav|4|100000|It was Eva Marie Saint and Sal Mineo.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002083.wav|4|100000|So let me put this simply for you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002084.wav|4|100000|- This medicine doesn't do a bit of good.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002085.wav|4|100000|Does everyone in your business talk like that?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002086.wav|4|100000|- Leave him alone!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002087.wav|4|100000|Small fucking towns.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002088.wav|4|100000|- You see him?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002089.wav|4|100000|Sorry about that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002090.wav|4|100000|- Uh, this morning.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002091.wav|4|100000|- We'll get you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002092.wav|4|100000|I have supersperm!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002093.wav|4|100000|2nd Platoon, listen up.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002094.wav|4|100000|Not this time.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002095.wav|4|100000|Yet firm too.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002096.wav|4|100000|Great distraction, man!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002098.wav|4|100000|I say we slip the message into one of the dog's collars, round up some fleas, put them on the dog.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002102.wav|4|100000|We got to stick together, until we know how to play him or until he slips up, then we get him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002107.wav|4|100000|If you wanna help the public and do your jobs best, sit quietly and listen to what I have to say.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002111.wav|4|100000|We just wanted to get married quietly, without any hoo-ha.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002112.wav|4|100000|Even if I don't know exactly what it is I do.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002113.wav|4|100000|Trouble is, Ann, when I'm standin' up my mind's lyin' down.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002114.wav|4|100000|Damn, if that don't feel like I got my balls back.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002115.wav|4|100000|All I know is that there is evil in the air..
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002116.wav|4|100000|And sooner or later we're gonna find where the money is.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002117.wav|4|100000|Mrs. Faber confessed to stabbing Rocco with her husband's knife once.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002118.wav|4|100000|You'll have to fill out a few of these forms, but...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002119.wav|4|100000|Well, my friend, all is not well on the hippie front.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002120.wav|4|100000|She's probably in black velvet with a feather in her hair.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002121.wav|4|100000|Tonight, I prefer to just dine in the shadows, thank you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002122.wav|4|100000|Sometimes the enemy of my enemy is my friend, Agent Gibbs.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002123.wav|4|100000|For not turning you back over to the marshals to hang.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002124.wav|4|100000|Just for what Master Wang has said, we are all Chinese.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002125.wav|4|100000|Um, can you call me back when you get this, please?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002126.wav|4|100000|So, is he the man of your life, or what happened?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002127.wav|4|100000|When white people see me coming into their store, they run.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002128.wav|4|100000|(GRUNTING)
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002129.wav|4|100000|Oh!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002130.wav|4|100000|Yes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002152.wav|4|100000|Venus cannot be her real name.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002153.wav|4|100000|- It was Teru Mikami's own decision...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002154.wav|4|100000|Just when we need him most.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002155.wav|4|100000|You look like you've been crying.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002156.wav|4|100000|Oh, just a spare power cell.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002157.wav|4|100000|You don't want to marry him?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002158.wav|4|100000|Bobby, you're to remember this number.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002159.wav|4|100000|No one has to die here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002160.wav|4|100000|I have an audition on Friday.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002161.wav|4|100000|# You workin' that, you trickin' that
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002162.wav|4|100000|Have fun together while I'm gone.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002163.wav|4|100000|He was only good in crafts!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002164.wav|4|100000|I am not making an accusation.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002179.wav|4|100000|He's a man, who kills when he wants to, if I want to, no power on earth can stop me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002203.wav|4|100000|No, it--it--it sounds weird, but it was totally a spur-of-the-moment thing,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002205.wav|4|100000|No, it's just, uh, she caught me at Dad's yesterday, and she really laid into me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002206.wav|4|100000|Very much what everyone...first thing that comes into their mind when they think about me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002207.wav|4|100000|I just spent more and more time at the diner, trying to make the place work.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002208.wav|4|100000|You know, you should check into Mr. Hennessey and see what he was doing last night.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002209.wav|4|100000|I think he hid it in the mineshaft, which is about a half a mile north.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002210.wav|4|100000|Do you know that for a fact, or is that just what you want to believe?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002211.wav|4|100000|Look, Chuck is my boyfriend, and he makes $12 an hour, so you stay away from him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002212.wav|4|100000|Because they definitely want me back, and I wanna be able to have the freedom to...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002213.wav|4|100000|We'll do a second line of resistance up there, on the hill, two hundred meters away.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002218.wav|4|100000|You can believe that!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002219.wav|4|100000|I'm looking for Pboo.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002220.wav|4|100000|Hayes at the plate.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002221.wav|4|100000|- Mister, you all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002222.wav|4|100000|Guys, my back hurts.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002223.wav|4|100000|What is going on?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002224.wav|4|100000|Garza's alibi checks out!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002225.wav|4|100000|No baby, come here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002226.wav|4|100000|Come watch the show.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002227.wav|4|100000|BIRTH CERTIFICATE - FATHER UNKNOWN
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002228.wav|4|100000|Let me see that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0004_002229.wav|4|100000|And then I'm frightened.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000063.wav|5|0|I just wanted you to loosen up, have a good time - lt's okay.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000064.wav|5|0|I'm just going to agitate some of your molecules and split them apart.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000065.wav|5|0|None of this would have been possible if you hadn't trusted the Cylon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000066.wav|5|100000|- Fine, once I got 'em six bags of chips and some fresh air.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000067.wav|5|100000|It's sort of the Dukes of Hazzard method of avoiding the cops, so...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000068.wav|5|100000|Because you were talking with Vincent's wife.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000069.wav|5|100000|Do you wanna punish me right now?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000070.wav|5|100000|What are you playing at this time?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000071.wav|5|100000|Forget all this is out here sometimes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000072.wav|5|100000|What did you say your name was?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000073.wav|5|100000|But really, I admire you very much.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000074.wav|5|100000|You made my sister spit at me
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000075.wav|5|100000|- I expect you to tell the truth.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000076.wav|5|100000|And what is your period, Mr. Smart?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000077.wav|5|100000|Take the room next to hers, Sonja.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000078.wav|5|100000|I've had enough excitement for one life.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000079.wav|5|100000|And poor Mary, she was so scared.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000080.wav|5|100000|- Did you use that as bait so--
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000081.wav|5|100000|I know what dengue fever is like.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000408.wav|5|100000|You know, you should check into Mr. Hennessey and see what he was doing last night.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000409.wav|5|100000|I think he hid it in the mineshaft, which is about a half a mile north.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000552.wav|5|100000|I slept with Jacob once when I had to go to his house to pick up my dogs.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000553.wav|5|100000|You know, I've been thinking, when you blew up your car back there, you blew up mine, too.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000555.wav|5|100000|I'm just going to go and talk to Daddy for a few minutes... and I'll be right back.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000557.wav|5|100000|I also built that library and used it to help a dozen guys get a high school diploma.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000610.wav|5|100000|What if Joan and Arthur cave to State and send her home?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000611.wav|5|100000|I think she wants me to rub olive oil on your taint.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000660.wav|5|100000|That's enough of that horseshit.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000661.wav|5|100000|- He gave me the explosives.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000662.wav|5|100000|You're really good at that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000663.wav|5|100000|What time is that, exactly?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000674.wav|5|100000|I asked her if she would check Alan's cellphone for any recently made calls.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000675.wav|5|100000|I'm real glad we have six months together before you have to go to...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000676.wav|5|100000|What difference does it make if my wife was in on it or not?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000677.wav|5|100000|I just want to say I'm-I'm so honored that you're-you're doing this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000679.wav|5|100000|I am falling for you, Caroline, and I'm pretty sure you feel the same.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000680.wav|5|100000|What it meant to you Was still another chance to move closer to blake.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000681.wav|5|100000|Let's go to a pet shop tomorrow and get a new cat, all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000682.wav|5|100000|You insisted that you would not be left at Casterly Rock under any circumstances.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000683.wav|5|100000|I'm really hoping that you and I can move forward with my book, Julianne.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000684.wav|5|100000|You will call an outsider in the middle of the night and tell him...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000685.wav|5|100000|I know you think you're saving your people, but you need to stop this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000686.wav|5|100000|You probably aren't the sort of person who is cut out for manipulating others.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000687.wav|5|100000|The guy hanging naked from the shower curtain rod... half dead from autoerotic asphyxiation?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000688.wav|5|100000|Well, just don't use no sticks or no knives or no piece of iron.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000689.wav|5|100000|Because now he'll have to stay with these people for a long, long time.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000690.wav|5|100000|An impairment of set-background discrimination can get you into a heap of trouble.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000691.wav|5|100000|It made you write a book about the seven steps to heal the heart?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000692.wav|5|100000|I heard that Ibaragi Doji who lives in Senjo-ga-take is a demon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000693.wav|5|100000|I cannot imagine what they will do if the cache is not returned whole.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000694.wav|5|100000|We would love to save your princess, but are looking for two royal geeks.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000695.wav|5|100000|If you came to say more cruel things to me, I'm going to bed.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000714.wav|5|100000|Easy on the gin, heavy on the tonic.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000715.wav|5|100000|I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000716.wav|5|100000|Peter Jennings and Tom Brokaw have bald spots!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000717.wav|5|100000|I'm not gonna inquire about that right now.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000718.wav|5|100000|I'm only a messenger, that must be obvious.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000719.wav|5|100000|But I never stopped to think about it
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000720.wav|5|100000|Did you see the eyes on that thing?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000721.wav|5|100000|And when I look back from a distance,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000722.wav|5|100000|You have nothing to return to in Stockholm.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000723.wav|5|100000|Look, I just need a few more minutes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000724.wav|5|100000|- Don, I can't seem to access this site.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000725.wav|5|100000|Don't you think his stomach is really big?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000726.wav|5|100000|What did you want them to be, wrong?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000727.wav|5|100000|Uh, I can't believe how fat I look.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000728.wav|5|100000|I bought it at piggly wiggly for 95 cents.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000729.wav|5|100000|When they rob you, you don't take money.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000730.wav|5|100000|They killed my boy and just drove on...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000731.wav|5|100000|Are you or are you not the Messiah?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000732.wav|5|100000|It was Eva Marie Saint and Sal Mineo.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000733.wav|5|100000|So let me put this simply for you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000734.wav|5|100000|- This medicine doesn't do a bit of good.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000735.wav|5|100000|Does everyone in your business talk like that?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000736.wav|5|100000|- Leave him alone!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000737.wav|5|100000|Small fucking towns.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000738.wav|5|100000|- You see him?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000739.wav|5|100000|Sorry about that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000740.wav|5|100000|- Uh, this morning.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000741.wav|5|100000|- We'll get you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000742.wav|5|100000|I have supersperm!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000743.wav|5|100000|2nd Platoon, listen up.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000744.wav|5|100000|Not this time.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000745.wav|5|100000|Yet firm too.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000746.wav|5|100000|Great distraction, man!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000748.wav|5|100000|I say we slip the message into one of the dog's collars, round up some fleas, put them on the dog.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000752.wav|5|100000|We got to stick together, until we know how to play him or until he slips up, then we get him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000757.wav|5|100000|If you wanna help the public and do your jobs best, sit quietly and listen to what I have to say.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000761.wav|5|100000|We just wanted to get married quietly, without any hoo-ha.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000762.wav|5|100000|Even if I don't know exactly what it is I do.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000763.wav|5|100000|Trouble is, Ann, when I'm standin' up my mind's lyin' down.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000764.wav|5|100000|Damn, if that don't feel like I got my balls back.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000765.wav|5|100000|All I know is that there is evil in the air..
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000766.wav|5|100000|And sooner or later we're gonna find where the money is.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000767.wav|5|100000|Mrs. Faber confessed to stabbing Rocco with her husband's knife once.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000768.wav|5|100000|You'll have to fill out a few of these forms, but...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000769.wav|5|100000|Well, my friend, all is not well on the hippie front.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000770.wav|5|100000|She's probably in black velvet with a feather in her hair.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000771.wav|5|100000|Tonight, I prefer to just dine in the shadows, thank you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000772.wav|5|100000|Sometimes the enemy of my enemy is my friend, Agent Gibbs.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000773.wav|5|100000|For not turning you back over to the marshals to hang.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000774.wav|5|100000|Just for what Master Wang has said, we are all Chinese.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000775.wav|5|100000|Um, can you call me back when you get this, please?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000776.wav|5|100000|So, is he the man of your life, or what happened?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000777.wav|5|100000|When white people see me coming into their store, they run.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000778.wav|5|100000|(GRUNTING)
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000779.wav|5|100000|Oh!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000780.wav|5|100000|Yes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000802.wav|5|100000|Venus cannot be her real name.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000803.wav|5|100000|- It was Teru Mikami's own decision...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000804.wav|5|100000|Just when we need him most.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000805.wav|5|100000|You look like you've been crying.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000806.wav|5|100000|Oh, just a spare power cell.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000807.wav|5|100000|You don't want to marry him?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000808.wav|5|100000|Bobby, you're to remember this number.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000809.wav|5|100000|No one has to die here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000810.wav|5|100000|I have an audition on Friday.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000811.wav|5|100000|# You workin' that, you trickin' that
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000812.wav|5|100000|Have fun together while I'm gone.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000813.wav|5|100000|He was only good in crafts!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000814.wav|5|100000|I am not making an accusation.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000829.wav|5|100000|He's a man, who kills when he wants to, if I want to, no power on earth can stop me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000853.wav|5|100000|No, it--it--it sounds weird, but it was totally a spur-of-the-moment thing,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000855.wav|5|100000|No, it's just, uh, she caught me at Dad's yesterday, and she really laid into me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000856.wav|5|100000|Very much what everyone...first thing that comes into their mind when they think about me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000857.wav|5|100000|I just spent more and more time at the diner, trying to make the place work.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000858.wav|5|100000|You know, you should check into Mr. Hennessey and see what he was doing last night.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000859.wav|5|100000|I think he hid it in the mineshaft, which is about a half a mile north.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000860.wav|5|100000|Do you know that for a fact, or is that just what you want to believe?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000861.wav|5|100000|Look, Chuck is my boyfriend, and he makes $12 an hour, so you stay away from him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000862.wav|5|100000|Because they definitely want me back, and I wanna be able to have the freedom to...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000863.wav|5|100000|We'll do a second line of resistance up there, on the hill, two hundred meters away.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000868.wav|5|100000|You can believe that!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000869.wav|5|100000|I'm looking for Pboo.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000870.wav|5|100000|Hayes at the plate.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000871.wav|5|100000|- Mister, you all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000872.wav|5|100000|Guys, my back hurts.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000873.wav|5|100000|What is going on?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000874.wav|5|100000|Garza's alibi checks out!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000875.wav|5|100000|No baby, come here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000876.wav|5|100000|Come watch the show.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000878.wav|5|100000|Let me see that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000879.wav|5|100000|And then I'm frightened.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000963.wav|5|2|I just wanted you to loosen up, have a good time - lt's okay.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000964.wav|5|2|I'm just going to agitate some of your molecules and split them apart.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000965.wav|5|2|None of this would have been possible if you hadn't trusted the Cylon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000966.wav|5|100000|- Fine, once I got 'em six bags of chips and some fresh air.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000967.wav|5|100000|It's sort of the Dukes of Hazzard method of avoiding the cops, so...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000968.wav|5|100000|Because you were talking with Vincent's wife.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000969.wav|5|100000|Do you wanna punish me right now?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000970.wav|5|100000|What are you playing at this time?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000971.wav|5|100000|Forget all this is out here sometimes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000972.wav|5|100000|What did you say your name was?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000973.wav|5|100000|But really, I admire you very much.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000974.wav|5|100000|You made my sister spit at me
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000975.wav|5|100000|- I expect you to tell the truth.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000976.wav|5|100000|And what is your period, Mr. Smart?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000977.wav|5|100000|Take the room next to hers, Sonja.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000978.wav|5|100000|I've had enough excitement for one life.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000979.wav|5|100000|And poor Mary, she was so scared.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000980.wav|5|100000|- Did you use that as bait so--
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000981.wav|5|100000|I know what dengue fever is like.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000982.wav|5|100000|But break it gently she is old ...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000983.wav|5|100000|We don't make anything off that one.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000984.wav|5|100000|- some manner of harm many moons ago.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000985.wav|5|100000|Hey, o'neill, hand me a bear claw.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_000986.wav|5|100000|Is impossible to keep this from Washington
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001001.wav|5|100000|What they do... is they will sit up in this higher energy state... and then drop down again.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001002.wav|5|100000|I slept with Jacob once when I had to go to his house to pick up my dogs.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001003.wav|5|100000|You know, I've been thinking, when you blew up your car back there, you blew up mine, too.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001005.wav|5|100000|I'm just going to go and talk to Daddy for a few minutes... and I'll be right back.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001007.wav|5|100000|I also built that library and used it to help a dozen guys get a high school diploma.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001008.wav|5|100000|No, that is an example of map... I've seen maps, certainly, that have my road on, for example.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001009.wav|5|100000|There are contractors that show up in pickup trucks, and they kind of watch you and surveil you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001022.wav|5|100000|Rest those little bones, while I go out and make a goddamn fool of myself.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001023.wav|5|100000|I can get you an achilles tendon in South Korea for anywhere between $200 and $1,200 dollars.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001024.wav|5|100000|- I could have a thousand years with you, and it would still be too soon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001025.wav|5|100000|What is the reason you were in the desert so close to the Mexican border?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001026.wav|5|100000|Why does everyone feel the need to have these things, these, like, symbols of adulthood?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001027.wav|5|100000|We were supposed to go to Opera House in it and conduct a big raid.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001260.wav|5|100000|I have an audition on Friday.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001261.wav|5|100000|# You workin' that, you trickin' that
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001262.wav|5|100000|Have fun together while I'm gone.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001263.wav|5|100000|He was only good in crafts!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001264.wav|5|100000|I am not making an accusation.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001279.wav|5|100000|He's a man, who kills when he wants to, if I want to, no power on earth can stop me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001303.wav|5|100000|No, it--it--it sounds weird, but it was totally a spur-of-the-moment thing,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001305.wav|5|100000|No, it's just, uh, she caught me at Dad's yesterday, and she really laid into me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001306.wav|5|100000|Very much what everyone...first thing that comes into their mind when they think about me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001307.wav|5|100000|I just spent more and more time at the diner, trying to make the place work.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001308.wav|5|100000|You know, you should check into Mr. Hennessey and see what he was doing last night.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001309.wav|5|100000|I think he hid it in the mineshaft, which is about a half a mile north.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001310.wav|5|100000|Do you know that for a fact, or is that just what you want to believe?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001311.wav|5|100000|Look, Chuck is my boyfriend, and he makes $12 an hour, so you stay away from him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001312.wav|5|100000|Because they definitely want me back, and I wanna be able to have the freedom to...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001313.wav|5|100000|We'll do a second line of resistance up there, on the hill, two hundred meters away.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001318.wav|5|100000|You can believe that!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001319.wav|5|100000|I'm looking for Pboo.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001320.wav|5|100000|Hayes at the plate.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001321.wav|5|100000|- Mister, you all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001322.wav|5|100000|Guys, my back hurts.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001323.wav|5|100000|What is going on?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001324.wav|5|100000|Garza's alibi checks out!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001325.wav|5|100000|No baby, come here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001326.wav|5|100000|Come watch the show.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001328.wav|5|100000|Let me see that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001329.wav|5|100000|And then I'm frightened.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001413.wav|5|3|I just wanted you to loosen up, have a good time - lt's okay.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001414.wav|5|3|I'm just going to agitate some of your molecules and split them apart.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001415.wav|5|3|None of this would have been possible if you hadn't trusted the Cylon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001416.wav|5|100000|- Fine, once I got 'em six bags of chips and some fresh air.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001417.wav|5|100000|It's sort of the Dukes of Hazzard method of avoiding the cops, so...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001418.wav|5|100000|Because you were talking with Vincent's wife.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001419.wav|5|100000|Do you wanna punish me right now?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001420.wav|5|100000|What are you playing at this time?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001421.wav|5|100000|Forget all this is out here sometimes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001422.wav|5|100000|What did you say your name was?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001423.wav|5|100000|But really, I admire you very much.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001424.wav|5|100000|You made my sister spit at me
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001425.wav|5|100000|- I expect you to tell the truth.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001426.wav|5|100000|And what is your period, Mr. Smart?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001427.wav|5|100000|Take the room next to hers, Sonja.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001428.wav|5|100000|I've had enough excitement for one life.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001429.wav|5|100000|And poor Mary, she was so scared.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001430.wav|5|100000|- Did you use that as bait so--
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001431.wav|5|100000|I know what dengue fever is like.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001432.wav|5|100000|But break it gently she is old ...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001433.wav|5|100000|We don't make anything off that one.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001434.wav|5|100000|- some manner of harm many moons ago.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001435.wav|5|100000|Hey, o'neill, hand me a bear claw.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001451.wav|5|100000|What they do... is they will sit up in this higher energy state... and then drop down again.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001452.wav|5|100000|I slept with Jacob once when I had to go to his house to pick up my dogs.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001453.wav|5|100000|You know, I've been thinking, when you blew up your car back there, you blew up mine, too.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001455.wav|5|100000|I'm just going to go and talk to Daddy for a few minutes... and I'll be right back.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001457.wav|5|100000|I also built that library and used it to help a dozen guys get a high school diploma.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001458.wav|5|100000|No, that is an example of map... I've seen maps, certainly, that have my road on, for example.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001459.wav|5|100000|There are contractors that show up in pickup trucks, and they kind of watch you and surveil you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001472.wav|5|100000|Rest those little bones, while I go out and make a goddamn fool of myself.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001473.wav|5|100000|I can get you an achilles tendon in South Korea for anywhere between $200 and $1,200 dollars.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001474.wav|5|100000|- I could have a thousand years with you, and it would still be too soon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001475.wav|5|100000|What is the reason you were in the desert so close to the Mexican border?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001476.wav|5|100000|Why does everyone feel the need to have these things, these, like, symbols of adulthood?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001477.wav|5|100000|We were supposed to go to Opera House in it and conduct a big raid.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001478.wav|5|100000|I've been keeping it a secret for months, and I'm going to stop hiding it.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001479.wav|5|100000|At the end of the month, I get a bonus, 10% of anything the horses make.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001480.wav|5|100000|The other two were floating in the hotel pool, and they weren't doing the backstroke.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001481.wav|5|100000|You know, I should've just done the full nickel the first time you busted me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001482.wav|5|100000|That guy's got two heads, a foot of reach on us, and no blind spot.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001483.wav|5|100000|One's the Bible, one's a book on Christmas... one's on how to be a carpenter.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001484.wav|5|100000|The safety of every man here rests with me, Caulder, and I can't trust you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001485.wav|5|100000|The world, you see, though it appears to be expanding infinitely, is truthfully quite small.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001486.wav|5|100000|- Yeah, an adult bear was milked half a dozen times, and then killed for this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001487.wav|5|100000|lot of lost souls took shepherd's call for blood seriously-- family values at its worst.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001488.wav|5|100000|Derek, I'd like to speak with your mom for a moment, is that all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001489.wav|5|100000|I'm Taylor's mother and I was just wondering if you created a fake profile online?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001490.wav|5|100000|Every time Brandon has a blow-up it's, like, always pointed at a stronger woman.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001491.wav|5|100000|So, I told him I'd give him a quick B.J. If he laid off.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001492.wav|5|100000|"Next day it was back to life back to reality"
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001493.wav|5|100000|I object to working on this case on moral grounds.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001494.wav|5|100000|Liquid nitrogen -- I use it to freeze the body parts.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001496.wav|5|100000|And what is it to you after all Miss Lister?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001497.wav|5|100000|Do me a favor, I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001498.wav|5|100000|I should get my dad a new pair of shoes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001499.wav|5|100000|Am I gonna have to hear this from you, too?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001500.wav|5|100000|Sark has demanded that you open her coffin for him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001501.wav|5|100000|Don't be so chatty, have your drink and move on.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001504.wav|5|100000|Why don't we just get it all out in open?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001505.wav|5|100000|- If you don't like me, let's get him someone else.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001506.wav|5|100000|Frank's not a guy that usually comes up with plans.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001507.wav|5|100000|I don't just abandon people when they leave the TARDIS.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001508.wav|5|100000|The Jews, those in the work squads, thought at first...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001509.wav|5|100000|All he done was to recommend Demetrius to the bank.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001510.wav|5|100000|What if Joan and Arthur cave to State and send her home?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001511.wav|5|100000|I think she wants me to rub olive oil on your taint.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001512.wav|5|100000|They were yelling at him, "Mr President, we need you to act!"
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001513.wav|5|100000|Yeah, in the 1920s a cat burglar named Nigel Hubbard left no fingerprints.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001514.wav|5|100000|- My father's had that book in a drawer since I was born.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001515.wav|5|100000|The risk of unpopular decision, competition, corruption, passivity, have prevented any action.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001516.wav|5|100000|I've always been a rational man with a great faith in science.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001517.wav|5|100000|If I had a big hollywood guy like you on my team,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001518.wav|5|100000|I don't think her boyfriend was too happy about her moving out.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001519.wav|5|100000|But this incident has helped me gain a new respect for him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001520.wav|5|100000|Why did you come with a pistol and point it at Tony?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001521.wav|5|100000|I realized I knew Herbert Gelman only after I'd heard his testimony.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001522.wav|5|100000|Meaningless words... you say, as you exhale to slow down the breath.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001523.wav|5|100000|L'm here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001524.wav|5|100000|But, but...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001525.wav|5|100000|Our classmate.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001526.wav|5|100000|- What, Colette?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001527.wav|5|100000|What's wrong?

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001529.wav|5|100000|Let's talk.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001541.wav|5|100000|Do you need ammo, guns?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001542.wav|5|100000|Why are you still here?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001543.wav|5|100000|His bullets untraceable of course.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001544.wav|5|100000|- First, our hosts attacked us.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001545.wav|5|100000|Your hair is so pretty.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001546.wav|5|100000|Shall we arrange this way
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001547.wav|5|100000|Don't lie to me, Logan.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001548.wav|5|100000|I won't show any mercy!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001549.wav|5|100000|- Not a sound all night.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001550.wav|5|100000|And you will be crushed.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001551.wav|5|100000|I've been walking for miles.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001552.wav|5|100000|Yeah. I'm glad you weren't.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001553.wav|5|100000|My wedding can suck it?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001554.wav|5|100000|This isn't the real list.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001555.wav|5|100000|I'm too fast for TV.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001556.wav|5|100000|I got these shoes here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001557.wav|5|100000|The Tysons are here waiting.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001558.wav|5|100000|- take care of everything else.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001559.wav|5|100000|Give him a fucking mustache.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001560.wav|5|100000|That's enough of that horseshit.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001561.wav|5|100000|- He gave me the explosives.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001562.wav|5|100000|You're really good at that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001563.wav|5|100000|What time is that, exactly?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001574.wav|5|100000|I asked her if she would check Alan's cellphone for any recently made calls.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001575.wav|5|100000|I'm real glad we have six months together before you have to go to...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001576.wav|5|100000|What difference does it make if my wife was in on it or not?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001577.wav|5|100000|I just want to say I'm-I'm so honored that you're-you're doing this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001579.wav|5|100000|I am falling for you, Caroline, and I'm pretty sure you feel the same.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001580.wav|5|100000|What it meant to you Was still another chance to move closer to blake.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001581.wav|5|100000|Let's go to a pet shop tomorrow and get a new cat, all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001582.wav|5|100000|You insisted that you would not be left at Casterly Rock under any circumstances.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001583.wav|5|100000|I'm really hoping that you and I can move forward with my book, Julianne.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001584.wav|5|100000|You will call an outsider in the middle of the night and tell him...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001585.wav|5|100000|I know you think you're saving your people, but you need to stop this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001586.wav|5|100000|You probably aren't the sort of person who is cut out for manipulating others.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001587.wav|5|100000|The guy hanging naked from the shower curtain rod... half dead from autoerotic asphyxiation?

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001617.wav|5|100000|I'm not gonna inquire about that right now.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001618.wav|5|100000|I'm only a messenger, that must be obvious.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001619.wav|5|100000|But I never stopped to think about it
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001620.wav|5|100000|Did you see the eyes on that thing?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001621.wav|5|100000|And when I look back from a distance,

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001634.wav|5|100000|- This medicine doesn't do a bit of good.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001639.wav|5|100000|Sorry about that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001640.wav|5|100000|- Uh, this morning.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001641.wav|5|100000|- We'll get you.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001646.wav|5|100000|Great distraction, man!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001648.wav|5|100000|I say we slip the message into one of the dog's collars, round up some fleas, put them on the dog.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001652.wav|5|100000|We got to stick together, until we know how to play him or until he slips up, then we get him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001657.wav|5|100000|If you wanna help the public and do your jobs best, sit quietly and listen to what I have to say.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001662.wav|5|100000|Even if I don't know exactly what it is I do.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001663.wav|5|100000|Trouble is, Ann, when I'm standin' up my mind's lyin' down.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001664.wav|5|100000|Damn, if that don't feel like I got my balls back.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001665.wav|5|100000|All I know is that there is evil in the air..
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001666.wav|5|100000|And sooner or later we're gonna find where the money is.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001669.wav|5|100000|Well, my friend, all is not well on the hippie front.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001670.wav|5|100000|She's probably in black velvet with a feather in her hair.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001671.wav|5|100000|Tonight, I prefer to just dine in the shadows, thank you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001672.wav|5|100000|Sometimes the enemy of my enemy is my friend, Agent Gibbs.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001673.wav|5|100000|For not turning you back over to the marshals to hang.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001674.wav|5|100000|Just for what Master Wang has said, we are all Chinese.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001675.wav|5|100000|Um, can you call me back when you get this, please?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001676.wav|5|100000|So, is he the man of your life, or what happened?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001677.wav|5|100000|When white people see me coming into their store, they run.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001702.wav|5|100000|Venus cannot be her real name.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001703.wav|5|100000|- It was Teru Mikami's own decision...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001704.wav|5|100000|Just when we need him most.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001705.wav|5|100000|You look like you've been crying.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001706.wav|5|100000|Oh, just a spare power cell.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001708.wav|5|100000|Bobby, you're to remember this number.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001709.wav|5|100000|No one has to die here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001710.wav|5|100000|I have an audition on Friday.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001711.wav|5|100000|# You workin' that, you trickin' that
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001712.wav|5|100000|Have fun together while I'm gone.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001713.wav|5|100000|He was only good in crafts!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001714.wav|5|100000|I am not making an accusation.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001729.wav|5|100000|He's a man, who kills when he wants to, if I want to, no power on earth can stop me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001753.wav|5|100000|No, it--it--it sounds weird, but it was totally a spur-of-the-moment thing,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001755.wav|5|100000|No, it's just, uh, she caught me at Dad's yesterday, and she really laid into me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001756.wav|5|100000|Very much what everyone...first thing that comes into their mind when they think about me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001757.wav|5|100000|I just spent more and more time at the diner, trying to make the place work.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001758.wav|5|100000|You know, you should check into Mr. Hennessey and see what he was doing last night.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001759.wav|5|100000|I think he hid it in the mineshaft, which is about a half a mile north.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001760.wav|5|100000|Do you know that for a fact, or is that just what you want to believe?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001761.wav|5|100000|Look, Chuck is my boyfriend, and he makes $12 an hour, so you stay away from him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001762.wav|5|100000|Because they definitely want me back, and I wanna be able to have the freedom to...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001763.wav|5|100000|We'll do a second line of resistance up there, on the hill, two hundred meters away.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001768.wav|5|100000|You can believe that!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001769.wav|5|100000|I'm looking for Pboo.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001772.wav|5|100000|Guys, my back hurts.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001773.wav|5|100000|What is going on?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001774.wav|5|100000|Garza's alibi checks out!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001775.wav|5|100000|No baby, come here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001776.wav|5|100000|Come watch the show.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001778.wav|5|100000|Let me see that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001779.wav|5|100000|And then I'm frightened.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001863.wav|5|4|I just wanted you to loosen up, have a good time - lt's okay.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001864.wav|5|4|I'm just going to agitate some of your molecules and split them apart.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001865.wav|5|4|None of this would have been possible if you hadn't trusted the Cylon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001866.wav|5|100000|- Fine, once I got 'em six bags of chips and some fresh air.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001867.wav|5|100000|It's sort of the Dukes of Hazzard method of avoiding the cops, so...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001868.wav|5|100000|Because you were talking with Vincent's wife.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001869.wav|5|100000|Do you wanna punish me right now?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001870.wav|5|100000|What are you playing at this time?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001871.wav|5|100000|Forget all this is out here sometimes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001872.wav|5|100000|What did you say your name was?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001873.wav|5|100000|But really, I admire you very much.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001874.wav|5|100000|You made my sister spit at me
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001875.wav|5|100000|- I expect you to tell the truth.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001876.wav|5|100000|And what is your period, Mr. Smart?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001877.wav|5|100000|Take the room next to hers, Sonja.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001878.wav|5|100000|I've had enough excitement for one life.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001879.wav|5|100000|And poor Mary, she was so scared.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001880.wav|5|100000|- Did you use that as bait so--
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001881.wav|5|100000|I know what dengue fever is like.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001882.wav|5|100000|But break it gently she is old ...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001883.wav|5|100000|We don't make anything off that one.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001884.wav|5|100000|- some manner of harm many moons ago.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001885.wav|5|100000|Hey, o'neill, hand me a bear claw.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001886.wav|5|100000|Is impossible to keep this from Washington
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001901.wav|5|100000|What they do... is they will sit up in this higher energy state... and then drop down again.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001902.wav|5|100000|I slept with Jacob once when I had to go to his house to pick up my dogs.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001903.wav|5|100000|You know, I've been thinking, when you blew up your car back there, you blew up mine, too.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001905.wav|5|100000|I'm just going to go and talk to Daddy for a few minutes... and I'll be right back.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001907.wav|5|100000|I also built that library and used it to help a dozen guys get a high school diploma.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001908.wav|5|100000|No, that is an example of map... I've seen maps, certainly, that have my road on, for example.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001909.wav|5|100000|There are contractors that show up in pickup trucks, and they kind of watch you and surveil you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001922.wav|5|100000|Rest those little bones, while I go out and make a goddamn fool of myself.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001923.wav|5|100000|I can get you an achilles tendon in South Korea for anywhere between $200 and $1,200 dollars.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001924.wav|5|100000|- I could have a thousand years with you, and it would still be too soon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001925.wav|5|100000|What is the reason you were in the desert so close to the Mexican border?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001926.wav|5|100000|Why does everyone feel the need to have these things, these, like, symbols of adulthood?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001927.wav|5|100000|We were supposed to go to Opera House in it and conduct a big raid.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001928.wav|5|100000|I've been keeping it a secret for months, and I'm going to stop hiding it.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001929.wav|5|100000|At the end of the month, I get a bonus, 10% of anything the horses make.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001930.wav|5|100000|The other two were floating in the hotel pool, and they weren't doing the backstroke.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001931.wav|5|100000|You know, I should've just done the full nickel the first time you busted me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001932.wav|5|100000|That guy's got two heads, a foot of reach on us, and no blind spot.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001933.wav|5|100000|One's the Bible, one's a book on Christmas... one's on how to be a carpenter.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001934.wav|5|100000|The safety of every man here rests with me, Caulder, and I can't trust you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001935.wav|5|100000|The world, you see, though it appears to be expanding infinitely, is truthfully quite small.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001936.wav|5|100000|- Yeah, an adult bear was milked half a dozen times, and then killed for this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001937.wav|5|100000|lot of lost souls took shepherd's call for blood seriously-- family values at its worst.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001938.wav|5|100000|Derek, I'd like to speak with your mom for a moment, is that all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001939.wav|5|100000|I'm Taylor's mother and I was just wondering if you created a fake profile online?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001940.wav|5|100000|Every time Brandon has a blow-up it's, like, always pointed at a stronger woman.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001941.wav|5|100000|So, I told him I'd give him a quick B.J. If he laid off.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001943.wav|5|100000|I object to working on this case on moral grounds.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001969.wav|5|100000|But this incident has helped me gain a new respect for him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001970.wav|5|100000|Why did you come with a pistol and point it at Tony?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_001971.wav|5|100000|I realized I knew Herbert Gelman only after I'd heard his testimony.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_002004.wav|5|100000|This isn't the real list.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_002005.wav|5|100000|I'm too fast for TV.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_002012.wav|5|100000|You're really good at that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_002013.wav|5|100000|What time is that, exactly?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_002024.wav|5|100000|I asked her if she would check Alan's cellphone for any recently made calls.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_002025.wav|5|100000|I'm real glad we have six months together before you have to go to...

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_002031.wav|5|100000|Let's go to a pet shop tomorrow and get a new cat, all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_002032.wav|5|100000|You insisted that you would not be left at Casterly Rock under any circumstances.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_002033.wav|5|100000|I'm really hoping that you and I can move forward with my book, Julianne.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_002034.wav|5|100000|You will call an outsider in the middle of the night and tell him...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_002035.wav|5|100000|I know you think you're saving your people, but you need to stop this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_002036.wav|5|100000|You probably aren't the sort of person who is cut out for manipulating others.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_002037.wav|5|100000|The guy hanging naked from the shower curtain rod... half dead from autoerotic asphyxiation?

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_002039.wav|5|100000|Because now he'll have to stay with these people for a long, long time.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_002069.wav|5|100000|But I never stopped to think about it
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_002070.wav|5|100000|Did you see the eyes on that thing?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_002071.wav|5|100000|And when I look back from a distance,

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_002206.wav|5|100000|Very much what everyone...first thing that comes into their mind when they think about me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_002207.wav|5|100000|I just spent more and more time at the diner, trying to make the place work.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_002208.wav|5|100000|You know, you should check into Mr. Hennessey and see what he was doing last night.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_002209.wav|5|100000|I think he hid it in the mineshaft, which is about a half a mile north.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_002210.wav|5|100000|Do you know that for a fact, or is that just what you want to believe?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_002211.wav|5|100000|Look, Chuck is my boyfriend, and he makes $12 an hour, so you stay away from him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0005_002212.wav|5|100000|Because they definitely want me back, and I wanna be able to have the freedom to...

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000064.wav|6|0|I'm just going to agitate some of your molecules and split them apart.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000065.wav|6|0|None of this would have been possible if you hadn't trusted the Cylon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000066.wav|6|100000|- Fine, once I got 'em six bags of chips and some fresh air.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000067.wav|6|100000|It's sort of the Dukes of Hazzard method of avoiding the cops, so...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000068.wav|6|100000|Because you were talking with Vincent's wife.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000069.wav|6|100000|Do you wanna punish me right now?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000070.wav|6|100000|What are you playing at this time?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000071.wav|6|100000|Forget all this is out here sometimes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000072.wav|6|100000|What did you say your name was?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000073.wav|6|100000|But really, I admire you very much.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000074.wav|6|100000|You made my sister spit at me
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000075.wav|6|100000|- I expect you to tell the truth.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000076.wav|6|100000|And what is your period, Mr. Smart?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000077.wav|6|100000|Take the room next to hers, Sonja.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000078.wav|6|100000|I've had enough excitement for one life.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000079.wav|6|100000|And poor Mary, she was so scared.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000080.wav|6|100000|- Did you use that as bait so--
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000081.wav|6|100000|I know what dengue fever is like.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000082.wav|6|100000|But break it gently she is old ...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000083.wav|6|100000|We don't make anything off that one.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000084.wav|6|100000|- some manner of harm many moons ago.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000102.wav|6|100000|I slept with Jacob once when I had to go to his house to pick up my dogs.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000103.wav|6|100000|You know, I've been thinking, when you blew up your car back there, you blew up mine, too.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000105.wav|6|100000|I'm just going to go and talk to Daddy for a few minutes... and I'll be right back.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000107.wav|6|100000|I also built that library and used it to help a dozen guys get a high school diploma.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000108.wav|6|100000|No, that is an example of map... I've seen maps, certainly, that have my road on, for example.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000109.wav|6|100000|There are contractors that show up in pickup trucks, and they kind of watch you and surveil you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000122.wav|6|100000|Rest those little bones, while I go out and make a goddamn fool of myself.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000123.wav|6|100000|I can get you an achilles tendon in South Korea for anywhere between $200 and $1,200 dollars.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000124.wav|6|100000|- I could have a thousand years with you, and it would still be too soon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000125.wav|6|100000|What is the reason you were in the desert so close to the Mexican border?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000126.wav|6|100000|Why does everyone feel the need to have these things, these, like, symbols of adulthood?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000127.wav|6|100000|We were supposed to go to Opera House in it and conduct a big raid.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000128.wav|6|100000|I've been keeping it a secret for months, and I'm going to stop hiding it.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000129.wav|6|100000|At the end of the month, I get a bonus, 10% of anything the horses make.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000130.wav|6|100000|The other two were floating in the hotel pool, and they weren't doing the backstroke.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000131.wav|6|100000|You know, I should've just done the full nickel the first time you busted me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000132.wav|6|100000|That guy's got two heads, a foot of reach on us, and no blind spot.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000133.wav|6|100000|One's the Bible, one's a book on Christmas... one's on how to be a carpenter.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000135.wav|6|100000|The world, you see, though it appears to be expanding infinitely, is truthfully quite small.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000136.wav|6|100000|- Yeah, an adult bear was milked half a dozen times, and then killed for this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000137.wav|6|100000|lot of lost souls took shepherd's call for blood seriously-- family values at its worst.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000138.wav|6|100000|Derek, I'd like to speak with your mom for a moment, is that all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000139.wav|6|100000|I'm Taylor's mother and I was just wondering if you created a fake profile online?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000140.wav|6|100000|Every time Brandon has a blow-up it's, like, always pointed at a stronger woman.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000141.wav|6|100000|So, I told him I'd give him a quick B.J. If he laid off.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000147.wav|6|100000|Do me a favor, I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000148.wav|6|100000|I should get my dad a new pair of shoes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000149.wav|6|100000|Am I gonna have to hear this from you, too?

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000154.wav|6|100000|Why don't we just get it all out in open?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000155.wav|6|100000|- If you don't like me, let's get him someone else.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000156.wav|6|100000|Frank's not a guy that usually comes up with plans.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000157.wav|6|100000|I don't just abandon people when they leave the TARDIS.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000158.wav|6|100000|The Jews, those in the work squads, thought at first...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000159.wav|6|100000|All he done was to recommend Demetrius to the bank.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000160.wav|6|100000|What if Joan and Arthur cave to State and send her home?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000161.wav|6|100000|I think she wants me to rub olive oil on your taint.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000162.wav|6|100000|They were yelling at him, "Mr President, we need you to act!"
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000163.wav|6|100000|Yeah, in the 1920s a cat burglar named Nigel Hubbard left no fingerprints.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000164.wav|6|100000|- My father's had that book in a drawer since I was born.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000165.wav|6|100000|The risk of unpopular decision, competition, corruption, passivity, have prevented any action.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000166.wav|6|100000|I've always been a rational man with a great faith in science.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000167.wav|6|100000|If I had a big hollywood guy like you on my team,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000168.wav|6|100000|I don't think her boyfriend was too happy about her moving out.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000169.wav|6|100000|But this incident has helped me gain a new respect for him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000170.wav|6|100000|Why did you come with a pistol and point it at Tony?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000171.wav|6|100000|I realized I knew Herbert Gelman only after I'd heard his testimony.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000172.wav|6|100000|Meaningless words... you say, as you exhale to slow down the breath.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000173.wav|6|100000|L'm here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000174.wav|6|100000|But, but...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000175.wav|6|100000|Our classmate.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000176.wav|6|100000|- What, Colette?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000177.wav|6|100000|What's wrong?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000178.wav|6|100000|(GONG SOUNDING)
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000179.wav|6|100000|Let's talk.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000191.wav|6|100000|Do you need ammo, guns?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000192.wav|6|100000|Why are you still here?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000193.wav|6|100000|His bullets untraceable of course.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000194.wav|6|100000|- First, our hosts attacked us.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000195.wav|6|100000|Your hair is so pretty.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000196.wav|6|100000|Shall we arrange this way
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000197.wav|6|100000|Don't lie to me, Logan.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000198.wav|6|100000|I won't show any mercy!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000199.wav|6|100000|- Not a sound all night.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000200.wav|6|100000|And you will be crushed.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000201.wav|6|100000|I've been walking for miles.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000202.wav|6|100000|Yeah. I'm glad you weren't.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000203.wav|6|100000|My wedding can suck it?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000204.wav|6|100000|This isn't the real list.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000205.wav|6|100000|I'm too fast for TV.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000206.wav|6|100000|I got these shoes here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000207.wav|6|100000|The Tysons are here waiting.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000208.wav|6|100000|- take care of everything else.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000209.wav|6|100000|Give him a fucking mustache.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000210.wav|6|100000|That's enough of that horseshit.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000211.wav|6|100000|- He gave me the explosives.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000212.wav|6|100000|You're really good at that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000213.wav|6|100000|What time is that, exactly?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000224.wav|6|100000|I asked her if she would check Alan's cellphone for any recently made calls.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000225.wav|6|100000|I'm real glad we have six months together before you have to go to...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000226.wav|6|100000|What difference does it make if my wife was in on it or not?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000227.wav|6|100000|I just want to say I'm-I'm so honored that you're-you're doing this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000229.wav|6|100000|I am falling for you, Caroline, and I'm pretty sure you feel the same.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000230.wav|6|100000|What it meant to you Was still another chance to move closer to blake.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000231.wav|6|100000|Let's go to a pet shop tomorrow and get a new cat, all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000232.wav|6|100000|You insisted that you would not be left at Casterly Rock under any circumstances.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000233.wav|6|100000|I'm really hoping that you and I can move forward with my book, Julianne.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000234.wav|6|100000|You will call an outsider in the middle of the night and tell him...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000235.wav|6|100000|I know you think you're saving your people, but you need to stop this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000236.wav|6|100000|You probably aren't the sort of person who is cut out for manipulating others.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000237.wav|6|100000|The guy hanging naked from the shower curtain rod... half dead from autoerotic asphyxiation?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000238.wav|6|100000|Well, just don't use no sticks or no knives or no piece of iron.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000239.wav|6|100000|Because now he'll have to stay with these people for a long, long time.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000240.wav|6|100000|An impairment of set-background discrimination can get you into a heap of trouble.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000241.wav|6|100000|It made you write a book about the seven steps to heal the heart?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000242.wav|6|100000|I heard that Ibaragi Doji who lives in Senjo-ga-take is a demon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000243.wav|6|100000|I cannot imagine what they will do if the cache is not returned whole.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000244.wav|6|100000|We would love to save your princess, but are looking for two royal geeks.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000264.wav|6|100000|Easy on the gin, heavy on the tonic.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000265.wav|6|100000|I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000266.wav|6|100000|Peter Jennings and Tom Brokaw have bald spots!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000267.wav|6|100000|I'm not gonna inquire about that right now.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000268.wav|6|100000|I'm only a messenger, that must be obvious.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000269.wav|6|100000|But I never stopped to think about it
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000270.wav|6|100000|Did you see the eyes on that thing?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000271.wav|6|100000|And when I look back from a distance,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000272.wav|6|100000|You have nothing to return to in Stockholm.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000273.wav|6|100000|Look, I just need a few more minutes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000274.wav|6|100000|- Don, I can't seem to access this site.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000275.wav|6|100000|Don't you think his stomach is really big?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000276.wav|6|100000|What did you want them to be, wrong?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000277.wav|6|100000|Uh, I can't believe how fat I look.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000278.wav|6|100000|I bought it at piggly wiggly for 95 cents.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000279.wav|6|100000|When they rob you, you don't take money.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000280.wav|6|100000|They killed my boy and just drove on...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000281.wav|6|100000|Are you or are you not the Messiah?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000282.wav|6|100000|It was Eva Marie Saint and Sal Mineo.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000283.wav|6|100000|So let me put this simply for you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000284.wav|6|100000|- This medicine doesn't do a bit of good.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000285.wav|6|100000|Does everyone in your business talk like that?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000286.wav|6|100000|- Leave him alone!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000287.wav|6|100000|Small fucking towns.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000288.wav|6|100000|- You see him?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000289.wav|6|100000|Sorry about that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000290.wav|6|100000|- Uh, this morning.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000291.wav|6|100000|- We'll get you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000292.wav|6|100000|I have supersperm!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000293.wav|6|100000|2nd Platoon, listen up.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000294.wav|6|100000|Not this time.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000295.wav|6|100000|Yet firm too.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000296.wav|6|100000|Great distraction, man!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000298.wav|6|100000|I say we slip the message into one of the dog's collars, round up some fleas, put them on the dog.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000302.wav|6|100000|We got to stick together, until we know how to play him or until he slips up, then we get him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000307.wav|6|100000|If you wanna help the public and do your jobs best, sit quietly and listen to what I have to say.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000311.wav|6|100000|We just wanted to get married quietly, without any hoo-ha.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000312.wav|6|100000|Even if I don't know exactly what it is I do.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000313.wav|6|100000|Trouble is, Ann, when I'm standin' up my mind's lyin' down.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000314.wav|6|100000|Damn, if that don't feel like I got my balls back.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000315.wav|6|100000|All I know is that there is evil in the air..
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000316.wav|6|100000|And sooner or later we're gonna find where the money is.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000317.wav|6|100000|Mrs. Faber confessed to stabbing Rocco with her husband's knife once.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000318.wav|6|100000|You'll have to fill out a few of these forms, but...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000319.wav|6|100000|Well, my friend, all is not well on the hippie front.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000320.wav|6|100000|She's probably in black velvet with a feather in her hair.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000321.wav|6|100000|Tonight, I prefer to just dine in the shadows, thank you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000322.wav|6|100000|Sometimes the enemy of my enemy is my friend, Agent Gibbs.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000323.wav|6|100000|For not turning you back over to the marshals to hang.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000324.wav|6|100000|Just for what Master Wang has said, we are all Chinese.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000325.wav|6|100000|Um, can you call me back when you get this, please?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000326.wav|6|100000|So, is he the man of your life, or what happened?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000327.wav|6|100000|When white people see me coming into their store, they run.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000328.wav|6|100000|(GRUNTING)
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000329.wav|6|100000|Oh!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000330.wav|6|100000|Yes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000352.wav|6|100000|Venus cannot be her real name.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000353.wav|6|100000|- It was Teru Mikami's own decision...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000354.wav|6|100000|Just when we need him most.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000355.wav|6|100000|You look like you've been crying.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000356.wav|6|100000|Oh, just a spare power cell.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000357.wav|6|100000|You don't want to marry him?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000358.wav|6|100000|Bobby, you're to remember this number.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000359.wav|6|100000|No one has to die here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000360.wav|6|100000|I have an audition on Friday.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000361.wav|6|100000|# You workin' that, you trickin' that
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000362.wav|6|100000|Have fun together while I'm gone.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000363.wav|6|100000|He was only good in crafts!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000364.wav|6|100000|I am not making an accusation.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000379.wav|6|100000|He's a man, who kills when he wants to, if I want to, no power on earth can stop me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000403.wav|6|100000|No, it--it--it sounds weird, but it was totally a spur-of-the-moment thing,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000405.wav|6|100000|No, it's just, uh, she caught me at Dad's yesterday, and she really laid into me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000406.wav|6|100000|Very much what everyone...first thing that comes into their mind when they think about me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000407.wav|6|100000|I just spent more and more time at the diner, trying to make the place work.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000408.wav|6|100000|You know, you should check into Mr. Hennessey and see what he was doing last night.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000409.wav|6|100000|I think he hid it in the mineshaft, which is about a half a mile north.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000410.wav|6|100000|Do you know that for a fact, or is that just what you want to believe?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000411.wav|6|100000|Look, Chuck is my boyfriend, and he makes $12 an hour, so you stay away from him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000412.wav|6|100000|Because they definitely want me back, and I wanna be able to have the freedom to...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000413.wav|6|100000|We'll do a second line of resistance up there, on the hill, two hundred meters away.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000418.wav|6|100000|You can believe that!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000419.wav|6|100000|I'm looking for Pboo.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000420.wav|6|100000|Hayes at the plate.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000421.wav|6|100000|- Mister, you all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000422.wav|6|100000|Guys, my back hurts.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000423.wav|6|100000|What is going on?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000424.wav|6|100000|Garza's alibi checks out!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000425.wav|6|100000|No baby, come here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000426.wav|6|100000|Come watch the show.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000427.wav|6|100000|BIRTH CERTIFICATE - FATHER UNKNOWN
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000428.wav|6|100000|Let me see that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000429.wav|6|100000|And then I'm frightened.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000513.wav|6|1|I just wanted you to loosen up, have a good time - lt's okay.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000514.wav|6|1|I'm just going to agitate some of your molecules and split them apart.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000515.wav|6|1|None of this would have been possible if you hadn't trusted the Cylon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000516.wav|6|100000|- Fine, once I got 'em six bags of chips and some fresh air.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000517.wav|6|100000|It's sort of the Dukes of Hazzard method of avoiding the cops, so...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000518.wav|6|100000|Because you were talking with Vincent's wife.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000519.wav|6|100000|Do you wanna punish me right now?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000520.wav|6|100000|What are you playing at this time?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000521.wav|6|100000|Forget all this is out here sometimes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000522.wav|6|100000|What did you say your name was?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000523.wav|6|100000|But really, I admire you very much.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000524.wav|6|100000|You made my sister spit at me
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000525.wav|6|100000|- I expect you to tell the truth.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000526.wav|6|100000|And what is your period, Mr. Smart?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000527.wav|6|100000|Take the room next to hers, Sonja.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000528.wav|6|100000|I've had enough excitement for one life.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000529.wav|6|100000|And poor Mary, she was so scared.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000530.wav|6|100000|- Did you use that as bait so--
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000531.wav|6|100000|I know what dengue fever is like.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000532.wav|6|100000|But break it gently she is old ...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000533.wav|6|100000|We don't make anything off that one.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000534.wav|6|100000|- some manner of harm many moons ago.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000535.wav|6|100000|Hey, o'neill, hand me a bear claw.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000536.wav|6|100000|Is impossible to keep this from Washington
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000551.wav|6|100000|What they do... is they will sit up in this higher energy state... and then drop down again.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000552.wav|6|100000|I slept with Jacob once when I had to go to his house to pick up my dogs.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000553.wav|6|100000|You know, I've been thinking, when you blew up your car back there, you blew up mine, too.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000555.wav|6|100000|I'm just going to go and talk to Daddy for a few minutes... and I'll be right back.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000557.wav|6|100000|I also built that library and used it to help a dozen guys get a high school diploma.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000558.wav|6|100000|No, that is an example of map... I've seen maps, certainly, that have my road on, for example.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000559.wav|6|100000|There are contractors that show up in pickup trucks, and they kind of watch you and surveil you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000572.wav|6|100000|Rest those little bones, while I go out and make a goddamn fool of myself.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000573.wav|6|100000|I can get you an achilles tendon in South Korea for anywhere between $200 and $1,200 dollars.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000574.wav|6|100000|- I could have a thousand years with you, and it would still be too soon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000575.wav|6|100000|What is the reason you were in the desert so close to the Mexican border?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000576.wav|6|100000|Why does everyone feel the need to have these things, these, like, symbols of adulthood?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000577.wav|6|100000|We were supposed to go to Opera House in it and conduct a big raid.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000578.wav|6|100000|I've been keeping it a secret for months, and I'm going to stop hiding it.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000579.wav|6|100000|At the end of the month, I get a bonus, 10% of anything the horses make.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000580.wav|6|100000|The other two were floating in the hotel pool, and they weren't doing the backstroke.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000581.wav|6|100000|You know, I should've just done the full nickel the first time you busted me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000582.wav|6|100000|That guy's got two heads, a foot of reach on us, and no blind spot.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000583.wav|6|100000|One's the Bible, one's a book on Christmas... one's on how to be a carpenter.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000584.wav|6|100000|The safety of every man here rests with me, Caulder, and I can't trust you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000585.wav|6|100000|The world, you see, though it appears to be expanding infinitely, is truthfully quite small.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000586.wav|6|100000|- Yeah, an adult bear was milked half a dozen times, and then killed for this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000587.wav|6|100000|lot of lost souls took shepherd's call for blood seriously-- family values at its worst.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000588.wav|6|100000|Derek, I'd like to speak with your mom for a moment, is that all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000589.wav|6|100000|I'm Taylor's mother and I was just wondering if you created a fake profile online?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000590.wav|6|100000|Every time Brandon has a blow-up it's, like, always pointed at a stronger woman.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000591.wav|6|100000|So, I told him I'd give him a quick B.J. If he laid off.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000592.wav|6|100000|"Next day it was back to life back to reality"
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000593.wav|6|100000|I object to working on this case on moral grounds.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000594.wav|6|100000|Liquid nitrogen -- I use it to freeze the body parts.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000596.wav|6|100000|And what is it to you after all Miss Lister?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000597.wav|6|100000|Do me a favor, I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000598.wav|6|100000|I should get my dad a new pair of shoes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000599.wav|6|100000|Am I gonna have to hear this from you, too?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000600.wav|6|100000|Sark has demanded that you open her coffin for him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000601.wav|6|100000|Don't be so chatty, have your drink and move on.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000604.wav|6|100000|Why don't we just get it all out in open?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000605.wav|6|100000|- If you don't like me, let's get him someone else.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000606.wav|6|100000|Frank's not a guy that usually comes up with plans.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000607.wav|6|100000|I don't just abandon people when they leave the TARDIS.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000608.wav|6|100000|The Jews, those in the work squads, thought at first...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000609.wav|6|100000|All he done was to recommend Demetrius to the bank.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000610.wav|6|100000|What if Joan and Arthur cave to State and send her home?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000611.wav|6|100000|I think she wants me to rub olive oil on your taint.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000612.wav|6|100000|They were yelling at him, "Mr President, we need you to act!"
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000613.wav|6|100000|Yeah, in the 1920s a cat burglar named Nigel Hubbard left no fingerprints.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000614.wav|6|100000|- My father's had that book in a drawer since I was born.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000618.wav|6|100000|I don't think her boyfriend was too happy about her moving out.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000619.wav|6|100000|But this incident has helped me gain a new respect for him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000620.wav|6|100000|Why did you come with a pistol and point it at Tony?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000621.wav|6|100000|I realized I knew Herbert Gelman only after I'd heard his testimony.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000622.wav|6|100000|Meaningless words... you say, as you exhale to slow down the breath.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000623.wav|6|100000|L'm here.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000625.wav|6|100000|Our classmate.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000626.wav|6|100000|- What, Colette?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000627.wav|6|100000|What's wrong?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000628.wav|6|100000|(GONG SOUNDING)
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000629.wav|6|100000|Let's talk.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000641.wav|6|100000|Do you need ammo, guns?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000642.wav|6|100000|Why are you still here?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000643.wav|6|100000|His bullets untraceable of course.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000644.wav|6|100000|- First, our hosts attacked us.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000645.wav|6|100000|Your hair is so pretty.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000646.wav|6|100000|Shall we arrange this way
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000647.wav|6|100000|Don't lie to me, Logan.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000648.wav|6|100000|I won't show any mercy!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000649.wav|6|100000|- Not a sound all night.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000650.wav|6|100000|And you will be crushed.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000651.wav|6|100000|I've been walking for miles.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000652.wav|6|100000|Yeah. I'm glad you weren't.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000653.wav|6|100000|My wedding can suck it?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000654.wav|6|100000|This isn't the real list.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000655.wav|6|100000|I'm too fast for TV.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000656.wav|6|100000|I got these shoes here.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000658.wav|6|100000|- take care of everything else.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000659.wav|6|100000|Give him a fucking mustache.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000660.wav|6|100000|That's enough of that horseshit.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000661.wav|6|100000|- He gave me the explosives.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000662.wav|6|100000|You're really good at that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000663.wav|6|100000|What time is that, exactly?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000674.wav|6|100000|I asked her if she would check Alan's cellphone for any recently made calls.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000675.wav|6|100000|I'm real glad we have six months together before you have to go to...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000676.wav|6|100000|What difference does it make if my wife was in on it or not?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000677.wav|6|100000|I just want to say I'm-I'm so honored that you're-you're doing this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000679.wav|6|100000|I am falling for you, Caroline, and I'm pretty sure you feel the same.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000680.wav|6|100000|What it meant to you Was still another chance to move closer to blake.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000681.wav|6|100000|Let's go to a pet shop tomorrow and get a new cat, all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000682.wav|6|100000|You insisted that you would not be left at Casterly Rock under any circumstances.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000683.wav|6|100000|I'm really hoping that you and I can move forward with my book, Julianne.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000684.wav|6|100000|You will call an outsider in the middle of the night and tell him...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000685.wav|6|100000|I know you think you're saving your people, but you need to stop this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000686.wav|6|100000|You probably aren't the sort of person who is cut out for manipulating others.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000687.wav|6|100000|The guy hanging naked from the shower curtain rod... half dead from autoerotic asphyxiation?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000688.wav|6|100000|Well, just don't use no sticks or no knives or no piece of iron.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000689.wav|6|100000|Because now he'll have to stay with these people for a long, long time.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000690.wav|6|100000|An impairment of set-background discrimination can get you into a heap of trouble.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000691.wav|6|100000|It made you write a book about the seven steps to heal the heart?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000692.wav|6|100000|I heard that Ibaragi Doji who lives in Senjo-ga-take is a demon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000693.wav|6|100000|I cannot imagine what they will do if the cache is not returned whole.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000715.wav|6|100000|I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000716.wav|6|100000|Peter Jennings and Tom Brokaw have bald spots!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000717.wav|6|100000|I'm not gonna inquire about that right now.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000718.wav|6|100000|I'm only a messenger, that must be obvious.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000719.wav|6|100000|But I never stopped to think about it
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000720.wav|6|100000|Did you see the eyes on that thing?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000721.wav|6|100000|And when I look back from a distance,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000722.wav|6|100000|You have nothing to return to in Stockholm.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000723.wav|6|100000|Look, I just need a few more minutes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000724.wav|6|100000|- Don, I can't seem to access this site.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000725.wav|6|100000|Don't you think his stomach is really big?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000726.wav|6|100000|What did you want them to be, wrong?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000727.wav|6|100000|Uh, I can't believe how fat I look.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000728.wav|6|100000|I bought it at piggly wiggly for 95 cents.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000729.wav|6|100000|When they rob you, you don't take money.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000730.wav|6|100000|They killed my boy and just drove on...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000731.wav|6|100000|Are you or are you not the Messiah?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000732.wav|6|100000|It was Eva Marie Saint and Sal Mineo.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000733.wav|6|100000|So let me put this simply for you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000734.wav|6|100000|- This medicine doesn't do a bit of good.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000735.wav|6|100000|Does everyone in your business talk like that?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000736.wav|6|100000|- Leave him alone!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000737.wav|6|100000|Small fucking towns.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000738.wav|6|100000|- You see him?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000739.wav|6|100000|Sorry about that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000740.wav|6|100000|- Uh, this morning.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000741.wav|6|100000|- We'll get you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000742.wav|6|100000|I have supersperm!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000743.wav|6|100000|2nd Platoon, listen up.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000744.wav|6|100000|Not this time.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000745.wav|6|100000|Yet firm too.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000746.wav|6|100000|Great distraction, man!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000748.wav|6|100000|I say we slip the message into one of the dog's collars, round up some fleas, put them on the dog.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000752.wav|6|100000|We got to stick together, until we know how to play him or until he slips up, then we get him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000757.wav|6|100000|If you wanna help the public and do your jobs best, sit quietly and listen to what I have to say.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000761.wav|6|100000|We just wanted to get married quietly, without any hoo-ha.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000762.wav|6|100000|Even if I don't know exactly what it is I do.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000763.wav|6|100000|Trouble is, Ann, when I'm standin' up my mind's lyin' down.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000764.wav|6|100000|Damn, if that don't feel like I got my balls back.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000765.wav|6|100000|All I know is that there is evil in the air..
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000766.wav|6|100000|And sooner or later we're gonna find where the money is.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000767.wav|6|100000|Mrs. Faber confessed to stabbing Rocco with her husband's knife once.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000769.wav|6|100000|Well, my friend, all is not well on the hippie front.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000770.wav|6|100000|She's probably in black velvet with a feather in her hair.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000771.wav|6|100000|Tonight, I prefer to just dine in the shadows, thank you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000772.wav|6|100000|Sometimes the enemy of my enemy is my friend, Agent Gibbs.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000773.wav|6|100000|For not turning you back over to the marshals to hang.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000774.wav|6|100000|Just for what Master Wang has said, we are all Chinese.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000775.wav|6|100000|Um, can you call me back when you get this, please?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000776.wav|6|100000|So, is he the man of your life, or what happened?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000777.wav|6|100000|When white people see me coming into their store, they run.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000780.wav|6|100000|Yes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000802.wav|6|100000|Venus cannot be her real name.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000803.wav|6|100000|- It was Teru Mikami's own decision...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000804.wav|6|100000|Just when we need him most.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000805.wav|6|100000|You look like you've been crying.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000806.wav|6|100000|Oh, just a spare power cell.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000807.wav|6|100000|You don't want to marry him?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000808.wav|6|100000|Bobby, you're to remember this number.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000809.wav|6|100000|No one has to die here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000810.wav|6|100000|I have an audition on Friday.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000811.wav|6|100000|# You workin' that, you trickin' that
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000812.wav|6|100000|Have fun together while I'm gone.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000813.wav|6|100000|He was only good in crafts!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000814.wav|6|100000|I am not making an accusation.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000829.wav|6|100000|He's a man, who kills when he wants to, if I want to, no power on earth can stop me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000853.wav|6|100000|No, it--it--it sounds weird, but it was totally a spur-of-the-moment thing,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000855.wav|6|100000|No, it's just, uh, she caught me at Dad's yesterday, and she really laid into me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000856.wav|6|100000|Very much what everyone...first thing that comes into their mind when they think about me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000857.wav|6|100000|I just spent more and more time at the diner, trying to make the place work.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000858.wav|6|100000|You know, you should check into Mr. Hennessey and see what he was doing last night.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000859.wav|6|100000|I think he hid it in the mineshaft, which is about a half a mile north.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000860.wav|6|100000|Do you know that for a fact, or is that just what you want to believe?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000861.wav|6|100000|Look, Chuck is my boyfriend, and he makes $12 an hour, so you stay away from him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000862.wav|6|100000|Because they definitely want me back, and I wanna be able to have the freedom to...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000863.wav|6|100000|We'll do a second line of resistance up there, on the hill, two hundred meters away.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000868.wav|6|100000|You can believe that!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000869.wav|6|100000|I'm looking for Pboo.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000870.wav|6|100000|Hayes at the plate.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000871.wav|6|100000|- Mister, you all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000872.wav|6|100000|Guys, my back hurts.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000873.wav|6|100000|What is going on?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000874.wav|6|100000|Garza's alibi checks out!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000875.wav|6|100000|No baby, come here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000876.wav|6|100000|Come watch the show.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000879.wav|6|100000|And then I'm frightened.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000963.wav|6|2|I just wanted you to loosen up, have a good time - lt's okay.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000964.wav|6|2|I'm just going to agitate some of your molecules and split them apart.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000965.wav|6|2|None of this would have been possible if you hadn't trusted the Cylon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000966.wav|6|100000|- Fine, once I got 'em six bags of chips and some fresh air.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000967.wav|6|100000|It's sort of the Dukes of Hazzard method of avoiding the cops, so...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000968.wav|6|100000|Because you were talking with Vincent's wife.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000969.wav|6|100000|Do you wanna punish me right now?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000970.wav|6|100000|What are you playing at this time?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000971.wav|6|100000|Forget all this is out here sometimes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000972.wav|6|100000|What did you say your name was?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000973.wav|6|100000|But really, I admire you very much.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_000974.wav|6|100000|You made my sister spit at me

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001061.wav|6|100000|I think she wants me to rub olive oil on your taint.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001067.wav|6|100000|If I had a big hollywood guy like you on my team,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001068.wav|6|100000|I don't think her boyfriend was too happy about her moving out.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001069.wav|6|100000|But this incident has helped me gain a new respect for him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001070.wav|6|100000|Why did you come with a pistol and point it at Tony?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001071.wav|6|100000|I realized I knew Herbert Gelman only after I'd heard his testimony.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001094.wav|6|100000|- First, our hosts attacked us.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001095.wav|6|100000|Your hair is so pretty.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001096.wav|6|100000|Shall we arrange this way
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001097.wav|6|100000|Don't lie to me, Logan.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001098.wav|6|100000|I won't show any mercy!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001099.wav|6|100000|- Not a sound all night.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001100.wav|6|100000|And you will be crushed.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001101.wav|6|100000|I've been walking for miles.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001102.wav|6|100000|Yeah. I'm glad you weren't.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001103.wav|6|100000|My wedding can suck it?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001104.wav|6|100000|This isn't the real list.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001105.wav|6|100000|I'm too fast for TV.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001106.wav|6|100000|I got these shoes here.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001109.wav|6|100000|Give him a fucking mustache.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001110.wav|6|100000|That's enough of that horseshit.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001111.wav|6|100000|- He gave me the explosives.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001112.wav|6|100000|You're really good at that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001113.wav|6|100000|What time is that, exactly?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001124.wav|6|100000|I asked her if she would check Alan's cellphone for any recently made calls.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001125.wav|6|100000|I'm real glad we have six months together before you have to go to...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001126.wav|6|100000|What difference does it make if my wife was in on it or not?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001127.wav|6|100000|I just want to say I'm-I'm so honored that you're-you're doing this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001129.wav|6|100000|I am falling for you, Caroline, and I'm pretty sure you feel the same.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001130.wav|6|100000|What it meant to you Was still another chance to move closer to blake.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001131.wav|6|100000|Let's go to a pet shop tomorrow and get a new cat, all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001132.wav|6|100000|You insisted that you would not be left at Casterly Rock under any circumstances.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001133.wav|6|100000|I'm really hoping that you and I can move forward with my book, Julianne.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001134.wav|6|100000|You will call an outsider in the middle of the night and tell him...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001135.wav|6|100000|I know you think you're saving your people, but you need to stop this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001136.wav|6|100000|You probably aren't the sort of person who is cut out for manipulating others.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001137.wav|6|100000|The guy hanging naked from the shower curtain rod... half dead from autoerotic asphyxiation?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001138.wav|6|100000|Well, just don't use no sticks or no knives or no piece of iron.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001139.wav|6|100000|Because now he'll have to stay with these people for a long, long time.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001140.wav|6|100000|An impairment of set-background discrimination can get you into a heap of trouble.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001141.wav|6|100000|It made you write a book about the seven steps to heal the heart?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001142.wav|6|100000|I heard that Ibaragi Doji who lives in Senjo-ga-take is a demon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001143.wav|6|100000|I cannot imagine what they will do if the cache is not returned whole.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001164.wav|6|100000|Easy on the gin, heavy on the tonic.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001165.wav|6|100000|I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001166.wav|6|100000|Peter Jennings and Tom Brokaw have bald spots!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001167.wav|6|100000|I'm not gonna inquire about that right now.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001168.wav|6|100000|I'm only a messenger, that must be obvious.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001169.wav|6|100000|But I never stopped to think about it
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001170.wav|6|100000|Did you see the eyes on that thing?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001171.wav|6|100000|And when I look back from a distance,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001172.wav|6|100000|You have nothing to return to in Stockholm.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001173.wav|6|100000|Look, I just need a few more minutes.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001175.wav|6|100000|Don't you think his stomach is really big?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001176.wav|6|100000|What did you want them to be, wrong?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001177.wav|6|100000|Uh, I can't believe how fat I look.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001178.wav|6|100000|I bought it at piggly wiggly for 95 cents.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001184.wav|6|100000|- This medicine doesn't do a bit of good.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001185.wav|6|100000|Does everyone in your business talk like that?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001186.wav|6|100000|- Leave him alone!

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001551.wav|6|100000|I've been walking for miles.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001552.wav|6|100000|Yeah. I'm glad you weren't.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001553.wav|6|100000|My wedding can suck it?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001554.wav|6|100000|This isn't the real list.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001555.wav|6|100000|I'm too fast for TV.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001556.wav|6|100000|I got these shoes here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001557.wav|6|100000|The Tysons are here waiting.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001558.wav|6|100000|- take care of everything else.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001559.wav|6|100000|Give him a fucking mustache.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001560.wav|6|100000|That's enough of that horseshit.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001561.wav|6|100000|- He gave me the explosives.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001562.wav|6|100000|You're really good at that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001563.wav|6|100000|What time is that, exactly?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001574.wav|6|100000|I asked her if she would check Alan's cellphone for any recently made calls.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001575.wav|6|100000|I'm real glad we have six months together before you have to go to...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001576.wav|6|100000|What difference does it make if my wife was in on it or not?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001577.wav|6|100000|I just want to say I'm-I'm so honored that you're-you're doing this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001579.wav|6|100000|I am falling for you, Caroline, and I'm pretty sure you feel the same.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001580.wav|6|100000|What it meant to you Was still another chance to move closer to blake.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001581.wav|6|100000|Let's go to a pet shop tomorrow and get a new cat, all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001582.wav|6|100000|You insisted that you would not be left at Casterly Rock under any circumstances.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001583.wav|6|100000|I'm really hoping that you and I can move forward with my book, Julianne.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001584.wav|6|100000|You will call an outsider in the middle of the night and tell him...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001585.wav|6|100000|I know you think you're saving your people, but you need to stop this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001586.wav|6|100000|You probably aren't the sort of person who is cut out for manipulating others.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001587.wav|6|100000|The guy hanging naked from the shower curtain rod... half dead from autoerotic asphyxiation?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001588.wav|6|100000|Well, just don't use no sticks or no knives or no piece of iron.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001589.wav|6|100000|Because now he'll have to stay with these people for a long, long time.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001590.wav|6|100000|An impairment of set-background discrimination can get you into a heap of trouble.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001591.wav|6|100000|It made you write a book about the seven steps to heal the heart?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001592.wav|6|100000|I heard that Ibaragi Doji who lives in Senjo-ga-take is a demon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001593.wav|6|100000|I cannot imagine what they will do if the cache is not returned whole.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001594.wav|6|100000|We would love to save your princess, but are looking for two royal geeks.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001595.wav|6|100000|If you came to say more cruel things to me, I'm going to bed.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001614.wav|6|100000|Easy on the gin, heavy on the tonic.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001615.wav|6|100000|I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001616.wav|6|100000|Peter Jennings and Tom Brokaw have bald spots!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001617.wav|6|100000|I'm not gonna inquire about that right now.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001618.wav|6|100000|I'm only a messenger, that must be obvious.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001619.wav|6|100000|But I never stopped to think about it
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001620.wav|6|100000|Did you see the eyes on that thing?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001621.wav|6|100000|And when I look back from a distance,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001622.wav|6|100000|You have nothing to return to in Stockholm.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001623.wav|6|100000|Look, I just need a few more minutes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001624.wav|6|100000|- Don, I can't seem to access this site.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001625.wav|6|100000|Don't you think his stomach is really big?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001626.wav|6|100000|What did you want them to be, wrong?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001627.wav|6|100000|Uh, I can't believe how fat I look.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001628.wav|6|100000|I bought it at piggly wiggly for 95 cents.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001629.wav|6|100000|When they rob you, you don't take money.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001630.wav|6|100000|They killed my boy and just drove on...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001631.wav|6|100000|Are you or are you not the Messiah?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001632.wav|6|100000|It was Eva Marie Saint and Sal Mineo.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001633.wav|6|100000|So let me put this simply for you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001634.wav|6|100000|- This medicine doesn't do a bit of good.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001635.wav|6|100000|Does everyone in your business talk like that?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001636.wav|6|100000|- Leave him alone!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001637.wav|6|100000|Small fucking towns.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001638.wav|6|100000|- You see him?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001639.wav|6|100000|Sorry about that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001640.wav|6|100000|- Uh, this morning.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001641.wav|6|100000|- We'll get you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001642.wav|6|100000|I have supersperm!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001643.wav|6|100000|2nd Platoon, listen up.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001644.wav|6|100000|Not this time.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001645.wav|6|100000|Yet firm too.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001646.wav|6|100000|Great distraction, man!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001648.wav|6|100000|I say we slip the message into one of the dog's collars, round up some fleas, put them on the dog.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001652.wav|6|100000|We got to stick together, until we know how to play him or until he slips up, then we get him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001657.wav|6|100000|If you wanna help the public and do your jobs best, sit quietly and listen to what I have to say.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001661.wav|6|100000|We just wanted to get married quietly, without any hoo-ha.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001662.wav|6|100000|Even if I don't know exactly what it is I do.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001663.wav|6|100000|Trouble is, Ann, when I'm standin' up my mind's lyin' down.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001664.wav|6|100000|Damn, if that don't feel like I got my balls back.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001665.wav|6|100000|All I know is that there is evil in the air..
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001666.wav|6|100000|And sooner or later we're gonna find where the money is.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001667.wav|6|100000|Mrs. Faber confessed to stabbing Rocco with her husband's knife once.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001668.wav|6|100000|You'll have to fill out a few of these forms, but...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001669.wav|6|100000|Well, my friend, all is not well on the hippie front.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001670.wav|6|100000|She's probably in black velvet with a feather in her hair.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001671.wav|6|100000|Tonight, I prefer to just dine in the shadows, thank you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001672.wav|6|100000|Sometimes the enemy of my enemy is my friend, Agent Gibbs.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001673.wav|6|100000|For not turning you back over to the marshals to hang.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001674.wav|6|100000|Just for what Master Wang has said, we are all Chinese.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001675.wav|6|100000|Um, can you call me back when you get this, please?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001676.wav|6|100000|So, is he the man of your life, or what happened?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001677.wav|6|100000|When white people see me coming into their store, they run.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001678.wav|6|100000|(GRUNTING)
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001679.wav|6|100000|Oh!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001680.wav|6|100000|Yes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001702.wav|6|100000|Venus cannot be her real name.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001703.wav|6|100000|- It was Teru Mikami's own decision...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001704.wav|6|100000|Just when we need him most.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001705.wav|6|100000|You look like you've been crying.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001706.wav|6|100000|Oh, just a spare power cell.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001707.wav|6|100000|You don't want to marry him?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001708.wav|6|100000|Bobby, you're to remember this number.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001709.wav|6|100000|No one has to die here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001710.wav|6|100000|I have an audition on Friday.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001711.wav|6|100000|# You workin' that, you trickin' that
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001712.wav|6|100000|Have fun together while I'm gone.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001713.wav|6|100000|He was only good in crafts!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001714.wav|6|100000|I am not making an accusation.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001729.wav|6|100000|He's a man, who kills when he wants to, if I want to, no power on earth can stop me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001753.wav|6|100000|No, it--it--it sounds weird, but it was totally a spur-of-the-moment thing,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001755.wav|6|100000|No, it's just, uh, she caught me at Dad's yesterday, and she really laid into me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001756.wav|6|100000|Very much what everyone...first thing that comes into their mind when they think about me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001757.wav|6|100000|I just spent more and more time at the diner, trying to make the place work.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001758.wav|6|100000|You know, you should check into Mr. Hennessey and see what he was doing last night.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001759.wav|6|100000|I think he hid it in the mineshaft, which is about a half a mile north.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001760.wav|6|100000|Do you know that for a fact, or is that just what you want to believe?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001761.wav|6|100000|Look, Chuck is my boyfriend, and he makes $12 an hour, so you stay away from him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001762.wav|6|100000|Because they definitely want me back, and I wanna be able to have the freedom to...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001763.wav|6|100000|We'll do a second line of resistance up there, on the hill, two hundred meters away.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001768.wav|6|100000|You can believe that!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001769.wav|6|100000|I'm looking for Pboo.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001770.wav|6|100000|Hayes at the plate.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001771.wav|6|100000|- Mister, you all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001772.wav|6|100000|Guys, my back hurts.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001773.wav|6|100000|What is going on?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001774.wav|6|100000|Garza's alibi checks out!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001775.wav|6|100000|No baby, come here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001776.wav|6|100000|Come watch the show.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001777.wav|6|100000|BIRTH CERTIFICATE - FATHER UNKNOWN
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001778.wav|6|100000|Let me see that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001779.wav|6|100000|And then I'm frightened.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001863.wav|6|4|I just wanted you to loosen up, have a good time - lt's okay.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001864.wav|6|4|I'm just going to agitate some of your molecules and split them apart.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001865.wav|6|4|None of this would have been possible if you hadn't trusted the Cylon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001866.wav|6|100000|- Fine, once I got 'em six bags of chips and some fresh air.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001867.wav|6|100000|It's sort of the Dukes of Hazzard method of avoiding the cops, so...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001868.wav|6|100000|Because you were talking with Vincent's wife.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001869.wav|6|100000|Do you wanna punish me right now?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001870.wav|6|100000|What are you playing at this time?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001871.wav|6|100000|Forget all this is out here sometimes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001872.wav|6|100000|What did you say your name was?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001873.wav|6|100000|But really, I admire you very much.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001874.wav|6|100000|You made my sister spit at me
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001875.wav|6|100000|- I expect you to tell the truth.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001876.wav|6|100000|And what is your period, Mr. Smart?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001877.wav|6|100000|Take the room next to hers, Sonja.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001878.wav|6|100000|I've had enough excitement for one life.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001879.wav|6|100000|And poor Mary, she was so scared.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001880.wav|6|100000|- Did you use that as bait so--
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001881.wav|6|100000|I know what dengue fever is like.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001882.wav|6|100000|But break it gently she is old ...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001883.wav|6|100000|We don't make anything off that one.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001884.wav|6|100000|- some manner of harm many moons ago.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001885.wav|6|100000|Hey, o'neill, hand me a bear claw.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001886.wav|6|100000|Is impossible to keep this from Washington
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001901.wav|6|100000|What they do... is they will sit up in this higher energy state... and then drop down again.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001902.wav|6|100000|I slept with Jacob once when I had to go to his house to pick up my dogs.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001903.wav|6|100000|You know, I've been thinking, when you blew up your car back there, you blew up mine, too.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001905.wav|6|100000|I'm just going to go and talk to Daddy for a few minutes... and I'll be right back.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001907.wav|6|100000|I also built that library and used it to help a dozen guys get a high school diploma.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001908.wav|6|100000|No, that is an example of map... I've seen maps, certainly, that have my road on, for example.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001909.wav|6|100000|There are contractors that show up in pickup trucks, and they kind of watch you and surveil you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_001922.wav|6|100000|Rest those little bones, while I go out and make a goddamn fool of myself.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_002153.wav|6|100000|- It was Teru Mikami's own decision...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_002154.wav|6|100000|Just when we need him most.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_002155.wav|6|100000|You look like you've been crying.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_002156.wav|6|100000|Oh, just a spare power cell.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_002157.wav|6|100000|You don't want to marry him?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_002158.wav|6|100000|Bobby, you're to remember this number.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_002159.wav|6|100000|No one has to die here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_002160.wav|6|100000|I have an audition on Friday.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_002161.wav|6|100000|# You workin' that, you trickin' that
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_002162.wav|6|100000|Have fun together while I'm gone.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_002163.wav|6|100000|He was only good in crafts!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_002164.wav|6|100000|I am not making an accusation.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_002179.wav|6|100000|He's a man, who kills when he wants to, if I want to, no power on earth can stop me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_002203.wav|6|100000|No, it--it--it sounds weird, but it was totally a spur-of-the-moment thing,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_002205.wav|6|100000|No, it's just, uh, she caught me at Dad's yesterday, and she really laid into me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_002206.wav|6|100000|Very much what everyone...first thing that comes into their mind when they think about me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_002207.wav|6|100000|I just spent more and more time at the diner, trying to make the place work.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_002208.wav|6|100000|You know, you should check into Mr. Hennessey and see what he was doing last night.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_002209.wav|6|100000|I think he hid it in the mineshaft, which is about a half a mile north.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_002210.wav|6|100000|Do you know that for a fact, or is that just what you want to believe?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_002211.wav|6|100000|Look, Chuck is my boyfriend, and he makes $12 an hour, so you stay away from him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_002212.wav|6|100000|Because they definitely want me back, and I wanna be able to have the freedom to...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_002213.wav|6|100000|We'll do a second line of resistance up there, on the hill, two hundred meters away.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_002223.wav|6|100000|What is going on?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_002224.wav|6|100000|Garza's alibi checks out!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_002225.wav|6|100000|No baby, come here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0006_002226.wav|6|100000|Come watch the show.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000064.wav|7|0|I'm just going to agitate some of your molecules and split them apart.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000065.wav|7|0|None of this would have been possible if you hadn't trusted the Cylon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000066.wav|7|100000|- Fine, once I got 'em six bags of chips and some fresh air.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000067.wav|7|100000|It's sort of the Dukes of Hazzard method of avoiding the cops, so...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000068.wav|7|100000|Because you were talking with Vincent's wife.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000069.wav|7|100000|Do you wanna punish me right now?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000070.wav|7|100000|What are you playing at this time?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000071.wav|7|100000|Forget all this is out here sometimes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000072.wav|7|100000|What did you say your name was?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000073.wav|7|100000|But really, I admire you very much.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000074.wav|7|100000|You made my sister spit at me
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000075.wav|7|100000|- I expect you to tell the truth.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000076.wav|7|100000|And what is your period, Mr. Smart?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000077.wav|7|100000|Take the room next to hers, Sonja.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000078.wav|7|100000|I've had enough excitement for one life.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000079.wav|7|100000|And poor Mary, she was so scared.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000080.wav|7|100000|- Did you use that as bait so--
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000081.wav|7|100000|I know what dengue fever is like.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000082.wav|7|100000|But break it gently she is old ...

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000101.wav|7|100000|What they do... is they will sit up in this higher energy state... and then drop down again.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000102.wav|7|100000|I slept with Jacob once when I had to go to his house to pick up my dogs.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000103.wav|7|100000|You know, I've been thinking, when you blew up your car back there, you blew up mine, too.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000105.wav|7|100000|I'm just going to go and talk to Daddy for a few minutes... and I'll be right back.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000107.wav|7|100000|I also built that library and used it to help a dozen guys get a high school diploma.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000108.wav|7|100000|No, that is an example of map... I've seen maps, certainly, that have my road on, for example.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000109.wav|7|100000|There are contractors that show up in pickup trucks, and they kind of watch you and surveil you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000122.wav|7|100000|Rest those little bones, while I go out and make a goddamn fool of myself.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000125.wav|7|100000|What is the reason you were in the desert so close to the Mexican border?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000126.wav|7|100000|Why does everyone feel the need to have these things, these, like, symbols of adulthood?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000127.wav|7|100000|We were supposed to go to Opera House in it and conduct a big raid.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000128.wav|7|100000|I've been keeping it a secret for months, and I'm going to stop hiding it.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000129.wav|7|100000|At the end of the month, I get a bonus, 10% of anything the horses make.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000130.wav|7|100000|The other two were floating in the hotel pool, and they weren't doing the backstroke.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000131.wav|7|100000|You know, I should've just done the full nickel the first time you busted me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000132.wav|7|100000|That guy's got two heads, a foot of reach on us, and no blind spot.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000135.wav|7|100000|The world, you see, though it appears to be expanding infinitely, is truthfully quite small.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000136.wav|7|100000|- Yeah, an adult bear was milked half a dozen times, and then killed for this.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000139.wav|7|100000|I'm Taylor's mother and I was just wondering if you created a fake profile online?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000140.wav|7|100000|Every time Brandon has a blow-up it's, like, always pointed at a stronger woman.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000141.wav|7|100000|So, I told him I'd give him a quick B.J. If he laid off.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000155.wav|7|100000|- If you don't like me, let's get him someone else.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000156.wav|7|100000|Frank's not a guy that usually comes up with plans.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000157.wav|7|100000|I don't just abandon people when they leave the TARDIS.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000158.wav|7|100000|The Jews, those in the work squads, thought at first...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000159.wav|7|100000|All he done was to recommend Demetrius to the bank.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000160.wav|7|100000|What if Joan and Arthur cave to State and send her home?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000161.wav|7|100000|I think she wants me to rub olive oil on your taint.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000162.wav|7|100000|They were yelling at him, "Mr President, we need you to act!"
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000163.wav|7|100000|Yeah, in the 1920s a cat burglar named Nigel Hubbard left no fingerprints.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000164.wav|7|100000|- My father's had that book in a drawer since I was born.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000167.wav|7|100000|If I had a big hollywood guy like you on my team,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000168.wav|7|100000|I don't think her boyfriend was too happy about her moving out.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000169.wav|7|100000|But this incident has helped me gain a new respect for him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000170.wav|7|100000|Why did you come with a pistol and point it at Tony?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000171.wav|7|100000|I realized I knew Herbert Gelman only after I'd heard his testimony.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000172.wav|7|100000|Meaningless words... you say, as you exhale to slow down the breath.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000173.wav|7|100000|L'm here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000174.wav|7|100000|But, but...

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000192.wav|7|100000|Why are you still here?

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000194.wav|7|100000|- First, our hosts attacked us.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000195.wav|7|100000|Your hair is so pretty.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000196.wav|7|100000|Shall we arrange this way
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000197.wav|7|100000|Don't lie to me, Logan.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000198.wav|7|100000|I won't show any mercy!

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000200.wav|7|100000|And you will be crushed.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000201.wav|7|100000|I've been walking for miles.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000202.wav|7|100000|Yeah. I'm glad you weren't.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000203.wav|7|100000|My wedding can suck it?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000204.wav|7|100000|This isn't the real list.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000205.wav|7|100000|I'm too fast for TV.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000206.wav|7|100000|I got these shoes here.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000208.wav|7|100000|- take care of everything else.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000209.wav|7|100000|Give him a fucking mustache.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000210.wav|7|100000|That's enough of that horseshit.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000211.wav|7|100000|- He gave me the explosives.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000212.wav|7|100000|You're really good at that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000213.wav|7|100000|What time is that, exactly?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000224.wav|7|100000|I asked her if she would check Alan's cellphone for any recently made calls.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000225.wav|7|100000|I'm real glad we have six months together before you have to go to...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000226.wav|7|100000|What difference does it make if my wife was in on it or not?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000227.wav|7|100000|I just want to say I'm-I'm so honored that you're-you're doing this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000229.wav|7|100000|I am falling for you, Caroline, and I'm pretty sure you feel the same.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000231.wav|7|100000|Let's go to a pet shop tomorrow and get a new cat, all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000232.wav|7|100000|You insisted that you would not be left at Casterly Rock under any circumstances.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000233.wav|7|100000|I'm really hoping that you and I can move forward with my book, Julianne.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000234.wav|7|100000|You will call an outsider in the middle of the night and tell him...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000235.wav|7|100000|I know you think you're saving your people, but you need to stop this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000236.wav|7|100000|You probably aren't the sort of person who is cut out for manipulating others.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000237.wav|7|100000|The guy hanging naked from the shower curtain rod... half dead from autoerotic asphyxiation?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000238.wav|7|100000|Well, just don't use no sticks or no knives or no piece of iron.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000239.wav|7|100000|Because now he'll have to stay with these people for a long, long time.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000240.wav|7|100000|An impairment of set-background discrimination can get you into a heap of trouble.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000241.wav|7|100000|It made you write a book about the seven steps to heal the heart?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000242.wav|7|100000|I heard that Ibaragi Doji who lives in Senjo-ga-take is a demon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000243.wav|7|100000|I cannot imagine what they will do if the cache is not returned whole.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000245.wav|7|100000|If you came to say more cruel things to me, I'm going to bed.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000264.wav|7|100000|Easy on the gin, heavy on the tonic.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000265.wav|7|100000|I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000266.wav|7|100000|Peter Jennings and Tom Brokaw have bald spots!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000267.wav|7|100000|I'm not gonna inquire about that right now.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000268.wav|7|100000|I'm only a messenger, that must be obvious.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000269.wav|7|100000|But I never stopped to think about it
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000270.wav|7|100000|Did you see the eyes on that thing?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000271.wav|7|100000|And when I look back from a distance,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000272.wav|7|100000|You have nothing to return to in Stockholm.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000273.wav|7|100000|Look, I just need a few more minutes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000274.wav|7|100000|- Don, I can't seem to access this site.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000275.wav|7|100000|Don't you think his stomach is really big?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000276.wav|7|100000|What did you want them to be, wrong?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000277.wav|7|100000|Uh, I can't believe how fat I look.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000278.wav|7|100000|I bought it at piggly wiggly for 95 cents.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000279.wav|7|100000|When they rob you, you don't take money.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000280.wav|7|100000|They killed my boy and just drove on...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000281.wav|7|100000|Are you or are you not the Messiah?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000282.wav|7|100000|It was Eva Marie Saint and Sal Mineo.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000283.wav|7|100000|So let me put this simply for you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000284.wav|7|100000|- This medicine doesn't do a bit of good.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000285.wav|7|100000|Does everyone in your business talk like that?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000286.wav|7|100000|- Leave him alone!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000287.wav|7|100000|Small fucking towns.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000288.wav|7|100000|- You see him?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000289.wav|7|100000|Sorry about that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000290.wav|7|100000|- Uh, this morning.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000291.wav|7|100000|- We'll get you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000292.wav|7|100000|I have supersperm!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000293.wav|7|100000|2nd Platoon, listen up.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000294.wav|7|100000|Not this time.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000295.wav|7|100000|Yet firm too.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000296.wav|7|100000|Great distraction, man!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000298.wav|7|100000|I say we slip the message into one of the dog's collars, round up some fleas, put them on the dog.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000302.wav|7|100000|We got to stick together, until we know how to play him or until he slips up, then we get him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000307.wav|7|100000|If you wanna help the public and do your jobs best, sit quietly and listen to what I have to say.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000311.wav|7|100000|We just wanted to get married quietly, without any hoo-ha.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000312.wav|7|100000|Even if I don't know exactly what it is I do.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000313.wav|7|100000|Trouble is, Ann, when I'm standin' up my mind's lyin' down.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000314.wav|7|100000|Damn, if that don't feel like I got my balls back.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000315.wav|7|100000|All I know is that there is evil in the air..
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000316.wav|7|100000|And sooner or later we're gonna find where the money is.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000317.wav|7|100000|Mrs. Faber confessed to stabbing Rocco with her husband's knife once.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000319.wav|7|100000|Well, my friend, all is not well on the hippie front.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000320.wav|7|100000|She's probably in black velvet with a feather in her hair.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000321.wav|7|100000|Tonight, I prefer to just dine in the shadows, thank you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000322.wav|7|100000|Sometimes the enemy of my enemy is my friend, Agent Gibbs.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000323.wav|7|100000|For not turning you back over to the marshals to hang.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000324.wav|7|100000|Just for what Master Wang has said, we are all Chinese.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000325.wav|7|100000|Um, can you call me back when you get this, please?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000326.wav|7|100000|So, is he the man of your life, or what happened?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000327.wav|7|100000|When white people see me coming into their store, they run.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000330.wav|7|100000|Yes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000352.wav|7|100000|Venus cannot be her real name.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000353.wav|7|100000|- It was Teru Mikami's own decision...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000354.wav|7|100000|Just when we need him most.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000355.wav|7|100000|You look like you've been crying.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000356.wav|7|100000|Oh, just a spare power cell.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000357.wav|7|100000|You don't want to marry him?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000358.wav|7|100000|Bobby, you're to remember this number.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000359.wav|7|100000|No one has to die here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000360.wav|7|100000|I have an audition on Friday.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000361.wav|7|100000|# You workin' that, you trickin' that
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000362.wav|7|100000|Have fun together while I'm gone.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000363.wav|7|100000|He was only good in crafts!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000364.wav|7|100000|I am not making an accusation.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000379.wav|7|100000|He's a man, who kills when he wants to, if I want to, no power on earth can stop me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000403.wav|7|100000|No, it--it--it sounds weird, but it was totally a spur-of-the-moment thing,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000405.wav|7|100000|No, it's just, uh, she caught me at Dad's yesterday, and she really laid into me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000406.wav|7|100000|Very much what everyone...first thing that comes into their mind when they think about me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000407.wav|7|100000|I just spent more and more time at the diner, trying to make the place work.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000408.wav|7|100000|You know, you should check into Mr. Hennessey and see what he was doing last night.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000409.wav|7|100000|I think he hid it in the mineshaft, which is about a half a mile north.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000410.wav|7|100000|Do you know that for a fact, or is that just what you want to believe?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000411.wav|7|100000|Look, Chuck is my boyfriend, and he makes $12 an hour, so you stay away from him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000412.wav|7|100000|Because they definitely want me back, and I wanna be able to have the freedom to...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000413.wav|7|100000|We'll do a second line of resistance up there, on the hill, two hundred meters away.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000418.wav|7|100000|You can believe that!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000419.wav|7|100000|I'm looking for Pboo.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000420.wav|7|100000|Hayes at the plate.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000421.wav|7|100000|- Mister, you all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000422.wav|7|100000|Guys, my back hurts.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000423.wav|7|100000|What is going on?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000424.wav|7|100000|Garza's alibi checks out!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000425.wav|7|100000|No baby, come here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000426.wav|7|100000|Come watch the show.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000428.wav|7|100000|Let me see that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000429.wav|7|100000|And then I'm frightened.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000513.wav|7|1|I just wanted you to loosen up, have a good time - lt's okay.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000514.wav|7|1|I'm just going to agitate some of your molecules and split them apart.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000515.wav|7|1|None of this would have been possible if you hadn't trusted the Cylon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000516.wav|7|100000|- Fine, once I got 'em six bags of chips and some fresh air.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000517.wav|7|100000|It's sort of the Dukes of Hazzard method of avoiding the cops, so...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000518.wav|7|100000|Because you were talking with Vincent's wife.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000519.wav|7|100000|Do you wanna punish me right now?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000520.wav|7|100000|What are you playing at this time?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000521.wav|7|100000|Forget all this is out here sometimes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000522.wav|7|100000|What did you say your name was?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000523.wav|7|100000|But really, I admire you very much.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000524.wav|7|100000|You made my sister spit at me
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000525.wav|7|100000|- I expect you to tell the truth.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000526.wav|7|100000|And what is your period, Mr. Smart?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000527.wav|7|100000|Take the room next to hers, Sonja.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000528.wav|7|100000|I've had enough excitement for one life.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000529.wav|7|100000|And poor Mary, she was so scared.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000530.wav|7|100000|- Did you use that as bait so--
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000531.wav|7|100000|I know what dengue fever is like.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000532.wav|7|100000|But break it gently she is old ...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000533.wav|7|100000|We don't make anything off that one.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000534.wav|7|100000|- some manner of harm many moons ago.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000535.wav|7|100000|Hey, o'neill, hand me a bear claw.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000536.wav|7|100000|Is impossible to keep this from Washington
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000551.wav|7|100000|What they do... is they will sit up in this higher energy state... and then drop down again.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000552.wav|7|100000|I slept with Jacob once when I had to go to his house to pick up my dogs.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000553.wav|7|100000|You know, I've been thinking, when you blew up your car back there, you blew up mine, too.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000555.wav|7|100000|I'm just going to go and talk to Daddy for a few minutes... and I'll be right back.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000557.wav|7|100000|I also built that library and used it to help a dozen guys get a high school diploma.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000558.wav|7|100000|No, that is an example of map... I've seen maps, certainly, that have my road on, for example.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000559.wav|7|100000|There are contractors that show up in pickup trucks, and they kind of watch you and surveil you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000572.wav|7|100000|Rest those little bones, while I go out and make a goddamn fool of myself.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000573.wav|7|100000|I can get you an achilles tendon in South Korea for anywhere between $200 and $1,200 dollars.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000574.wav|7|100000|- I could have a thousand years with you, and it would still be too soon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000575.wav|7|100000|What is the reason you were in the desert so close to the Mexican border?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000576.wav|7|100000|Why does everyone feel the need to have these things, these, like, symbols of adulthood?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000577.wav|7|100000|We were supposed to go to Opera House in it and conduct a big raid.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000578.wav|7|100000|I've been keeping it a secret for months, and I'm going to stop hiding it.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000579.wav|7|100000|At the end of the month, I get a bonus, 10% of anything the horses make.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000580.wav|7|100000|The other two were floating in the hotel pool, and they weren't doing the backstroke.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000581.wav|7|100000|You know, I should've just done the full nickel the first time you busted me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000582.wav|7|100000|That guy's got two heads, a foot of reach on us, and no blind spot.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000583.wav|7|100000|One's the Bible, one's a book on Christmas... one's on how to be a carpenter.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000584.wav|7|100000|The safety of every man here rests with me, Caulder, and I can't trust you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000585.wav|7|100000|The world, you see, though it appears to be expanding infinitely, is truthfully quite small.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000586.wav|7|100000|- Yeah, an adult bear was milked half a dozen times, and then killed for this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000587.wav|7|100000|lot of lost souls took shepherd's call for blood seriously-- family values at its worst.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000588.wav|7|100000|Derek, I'd like to speak with your mom for a moment, is that all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000589.wav|7|100000|I'm Taylor's mother and I was just wondering if you created a fake profile online?

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000860.wav|7|100000|Do you know that for a fact, or is that just what you want to believe?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000861.wav|7|100000|Look, Chuck is my boyfriend, and he makes $12 an hour, so you stay away from him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000862.wav|7|100000|Because they definitely want me back, and I wanna be able to have the freedom to...

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000964.wav|7|2|I'm just going to agitate some of your molecules and split them apart.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000965.wav|7|2|None of this would have been possible if you hadn't trusted the Cylon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000966.wav|7|100000|- Fine, once I got 'em six bags of chips and some fresh air.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000967.wav|7|100000|It's sort of the Dukes of Hazzard method of avoiding the cops, so...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000968.wav|7|100000|Because you were talking with Vincent's wife.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000969.wav|7|100000|Do you wanna punish me right now?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000970.wav|7|100000|What are you playing at this time?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000971.wav|7|100000|Forget all this is out here sometimes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000972.wav|7|100000|What did you say your name was?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000973.wav|7|100000|But really, I admire you very much.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000975.wav|7|100000|- I expect you to tell the truth.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000976.wav|7|100000|And what is your period, Mr. Smart?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000977.wav|7|100000|Take the room next to hers, Sonja.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_000982.wav|7|100000|But break it gently she is old ...

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001057.wav|7|100000|I don't just abandon people when they leave the TARDIS.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001058.wav|7|100000|The Jews, those in the work squads, thought at first...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001059.wav|7|100000|All he done was to recommend Demetrius to the bank.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001060.wav|7|100000|What if Joan and Arthur cave to State and send her home?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001061.wav|7|100000|I think she wants me to rub olive oil on your taint.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001100.wav|7|100000|And you will be crushed.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001101.wav|7|100000|I've been walking for miles.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001102.wav|7|100000|Yeah. I'm glad you weren't.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001103.wav|7|100000|My wedding can suck it?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001104.wav|7|100000|This isn't the real list.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001105.wav|7|100000|I'm too fast for TV.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001106.wav|7|100000|I got these shoes here.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001110.wav|7|100000|That's enough of that horseshit.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001111.wav|7|100000|- He gave me the explosives.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001112.wav|7|100000|You're really good at that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001113.wav|7|100000|What time is that, exactly?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001124.wav|7|100000|I asked her if she would check Alan's cellphone for any recently made calls.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001125.wav|7|100000|I'm real glad we have six months together before you have to go to...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001126.wav|7|100000|What difference does it make if my wife was in on it or not?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001127.wav|7|100000|I just want to say I'm-I'm so honored that you're-you're doing this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001129.wav|7|100000|I am falling for you, Caroline, and I'm pretty sure you feel the same.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001131.wav|7|100000|Let's go to a pet shop tomorrow and get a new cat, all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001132.wav|7|100000|You insisted that you would not be left at Casterly Rock under any circumstances.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001133.wav|7|100000|I'm really hoping that you and I can move forward with my book, Julianne.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001134.wav|7|100000|You will call an outsider in the middle of the night and tell him...

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001136.wav|7|100000|You probably aren't the sort of person who is cut out for manipulating others.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001137.wav|7|100000|The guy hanging naked from the shower curtain rod... half dead from autoerotic asphyxiation?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001138.wav|7|100000|Well, just don't use no sticks or no knives or no piece of iron.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001139.wav|7|100000|Because now he'll have to stay with these people for a long, long time.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001165.wav|7|100000|I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001166.wav|7|100000|Peter Jennings and Tom Brokaw have bald spots!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001167.wav|7|100000|I'm not gonna inquire about that right now.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001169.wav|7|100000|But I never stopped to think about it
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001170.wav|7|100000|Did you see the eyes on that thing?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001171.wav|7|100000|And when I look back from a distance,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001172.wav|7|100000|You have nothing to return to in Stockholm.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001173.wav|7|100000|Look, I just need a few more minutes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001174.wav|7|100000|- Don, I can't seem to access this site.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001175.wav|7|100000|Don't you think his stomach is really big?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001176.wav|7|100000|What did you want them to be, wrong?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001177.wav|7|100000|Uh, I can't believe how fat I look.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001178.wav|7|100000|I bought it at piggly wiggly for 95 cents.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001179.wav|7|100000|When they rob you, you don't take money.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001180.wav|7|100000|They killed my boy and just drove on...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001181.wav|7|100000|Are you or are you not the Messiah?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001182.wav|7|100000|It was Eva Marie Saint and Sal Mineo.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001183.wav|7|100000|So let me put this simply for you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001184.wav|7|100000|- This medicine doesn't do a bit of good.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001185.wav|7|100000|Does everyone in your business talk like that?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001186.wav|7|100000|- Leave him alone!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001187.wav|7|100000|Small fucking towns.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001188.wav|7|100000|- You see him?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001189.wav|7|100000|Sorry about that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001190.wav|7|100000|- Uh, this morning.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001191.wav|7|100000|- We'll get you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001192.wav|7|100000|I have supersperm!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001193.wav|7|100000|2nd Platoon, listen up.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001194.wav|7|100000|Not this time.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001195.wav|7|100000|Yet firm too.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001196.wav|7|100000|Great distraction, man!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001198.wav|7|100000|I say we slip the message into one of the dog's collars, round up some fleas, put them on the dog.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001202.wav|7|100000|We got to stick together, until we know how to play him or until he slips up, then we get him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001207.wav|7|100000|If you wanna help the public and do your jobs best, sit quietly and listen to what I have to say.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001211.wav|7|100000|We just wanted to get married quietly, without any hoo-ha.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001212.wav|7|100000|Even if I don't know exactly what it is I do.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001213.wav|7|100000|Trouble is, Ann, when I'm standin' up my mind's lyin' down.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001214.wav|7|100000|Damn, if that don't feel like I got my balls back.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001215.wav|7|100000|All I know is that there is evil in the air..
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001216.wav|7|100000|And sooner or later we're gonna find where the money is.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001217.wav|7|100000|Mrs. Faber confessed to stabbing Rocco with her husband's knife once.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001218.wav|7|100000|You'll have to fill out a few of these forms, but...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001219.wav|7|100000|Well, my friend, all is not well on the hippie front.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001220.wav|7|100000|She's probably in black velvet with a feather in her hair.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001221.wav|7|100000|Tonight, I prefer to just dine in the shadows, thank you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001222.wav|7|100000|Sometimes the enemy of my enemy is my friend, Agent Gibbs.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001223.wav|7|100000|For not turning you back over to the marshals to hang.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001224.wav|7|100000|Just for what Master Wang has said, we are all Chinese.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001225.wav|7|100000|Um, can you call me back when you get this, please?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001226.wav|7|100000|So, is he the man of your life, or what happened?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001227.wav|7|100000|When white people see me coming into their store, they run.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001229.wav|7|100000|Oh!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001230.wav|7|100000|Yes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001252.wav|7|100000|Venus cannot be her real name.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001253.wav|7|100000|- It was Teru Mikami's own decision...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001254.wav|7|100000|Just when we need him most.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001255.wav|7|100000|You look like you've been crying.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001256.wav|7|100000|Oh, just a spare power cell.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001257.wav|7|100000|You don't want to marry him?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001258.wav|7|100000|Bobby, you're to remember this number.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001259.wav|7|100000|No one has to die here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001260.wav|7|100000|I have an audition on Friday.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001261.wav|7|100000|# You workin' that, you trickin' that
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001262.wav|7|100000|Have fun together while I'm gone.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001263.wav|7|100000|He was only good in crafts!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001264.wav|7|100000|I am not making an accusation.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001279.wav|7|100000|He's a man, who kills when he wants to, if I want to, no power on earth can stop me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001303.wav|7|100000|No, it--it--it sounds weird, but it was totally a spur-of-the-moment thing,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001305.wav|7|100000|No, it's just, uh, she caught me at Dad's yesterday, and she really laid into me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001306.wav|7|100000|Very much what everyone...first thing that comes into their mind when they think about me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001307.wav|7|100000|I just spent more and more time at the diner, trying to make the place work.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001308.wav|7|100000|You know, you should check into Mr. Hennessey and see what he was doing last night.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001309.wav|7|100000|I think he hid it in the mineshaft, which is about a half a mile north.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001310.wav|7|100000|Do you know that for a fact, or is that just what you want to believe?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001311.wav|7|100000|Look, Chuck is my boyfriend, and he makes $12 an hour, so you stay away from him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001312.wav|7|100000|Because they definitely want me back, and I wanna be able to have the freedom to...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001313.wav|7|100000|We'll do a second line of resistance up there, on the hill, two hundred meters away.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001318.wav|7|100000|You can believe that!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001319.wav|7|100000|I'm looking for Pboo.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001320.wav|7|100000|Hayes at the plate.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001321.wav|7|100000|- Mister, you all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001322.wav|7|100000|Guys, my back hurts.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001323.wav|7|100000|What is going on?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001324.wav|7|100000|Garza's alibi checks out!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001325.wav|7|100000|No baby, come here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001326.wav|7|100000|Come watch the show.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001327.wav|7|100000|BIRTH CERTIFICATE - FATHER UNKNOWN
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001328.wav|7|100000|Let me see that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001329.wav|7|100000|And then I'm frightened.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001413.wav|7|3|I just wanted you to loosen up, have a good time - lt's okay.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001414.wav|7|3|I'm just going to agitate some of your molecules and split them apart.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001415.wav|7|3|None of this would have been possible if you hadn't trusted the Cylon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001416.wav|7|100000|- Fine, once I got 'em six bags of chips and some fresh air.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001417.wav|7|100000|It's sort of the Dukes of Hazzard method of avoiding the cops, so...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001418.wav|7|100000|Because you were talking with Vincent's wife.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001419.wav|7|100000|Do you wanna punish me right now?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001420.wav|7|100000|What are you playing at this time?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001421.wav|7|100000|Forget all this is out here sometimes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001422.wav|7|100000|What did you say your name was?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001423.wav|7|100000|But really, I admire you very much.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001424.wav|7|100000|You made my sister spit at me
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001425.wav|7|100000|- I expect you to tell the truth.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001426.wav|7|100000|And what is your period, Mr. Smart?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001427.wav|7|100000|Take the room next to hers, Sonja.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001428.wav|7|100000|I've had enough excitement for one life.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001429.wav|7|100000|And poor Mary, she was so scared.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001430.wav|7|100000|- Did you use that as bait so--
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001431.wav|7|100000|I know what dengue fever is like.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001432.wav|7|100000|But break it gently she is old ...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001433.wav|7|100000|We don't make anything off that one.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001434.wav|7|100000|- some manner of harm many moons ago.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001435.wav|7|100000|Hey, o'neill, hand me a bear claw.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001451.wav|7|100000|What they do... is they will sit up in this higher energy state... and then drop down again.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001452.wav|7|100000|I slept with Jacob once when I had to go to his house to pick up my dogs.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001453.wav|7|100000|You know, I've been thinking, when you blew up your car back there, you blew up mine, too.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001455.wav|7|100000|I'm just going to go and talk to Daddy for a few minutes... and I'll be right back.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001457.wav|7|100000|I also built that library and used it to help a dozen guys get a high school diploma.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001458.wav|7|100000|No, that is an example of map... I've seen maps, certainly, that have my road on, for example.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001459.wav|7|100000|There are contractors that show up in pickup trucks, and they kind of watch you and surveil you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001472.wav|7|100000|Rest those little bones, while I go out and make a goddamn fool of myself.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001473.wav|7|100000|I can get you an achilles tendon in South Korea for anywhere between $200 and $1,200 dollars.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001474.wav|7|100000|- I could have a thousand years with you, and it would still be too soon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001475.wav|7|100000|What is the reason you were in the desert so close to the Mexican border?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001476.wav|7|100000|Why does everyone feel the need to have these things, these, like, symbols of adulthood?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001477.wav|7|100000|We were supposed to go to Opera House in it and conduct a big raid.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001478.wav|7|100000|I've been keeping it a secret for months, and I'm going to stop hiding it.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001479.wav|7|100000|At the end of the month, I get a bonus, 10% of anything the horses make.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001480.wav|7|100000|The other two were floating in the hotel pool, and they weren't doing the backstroke.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001481.wav|7|100000|You know, I should've just done the full nickel the first time you busted me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001482.wav|7|100000|That guy's got two heads, a foot of reach on us, and no blind spot.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001483.wav|7|100000|One's the Bible, one's a book on Christmas... one's on how to be a carpenter.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001484.wav|7|100000|The safety of every man here rests with me, Caulder, and I can't trust you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001485.wav|7|100000|The world, you see, though it appears to be expanding infinitely, is truthfully quite small.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001486.wav|7|100000|- Yeah, an adult bear was milked half a dozen times, and then killed for this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001487.wav|7|100000|lot of lost souls took shepherd's call for blood seriously-- family values at its worst.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001488.wav|7|100000|Derek, I'd like to speak with your mom for a moment, is that all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001489.wav|7|100000|I'm Taylor's mother and I was just wondering if you created a fake profile online?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001490.wav|7|100000|Every time Brandon has a blow-up it's, like, always pointed at a stronger woman.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001491.wav|7|100000|So, I told him I'd give him a quick B.J. If he laid off.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001493.wav|7|100000|I object to working on this case on moral grounds.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001497.wav|7|100000|Do me a favor, I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001498.wav|7|100000|I should get my dad a new pair of shoes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001499.wav|7|100000|Am I gonna have to hear this from you, too?

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001504.wav|7|100000|Why don't we just get it all out in open?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001505.wav|7|100000|- If you don't like me, let's get him someone else.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001506.wav|7|100000|Frank's not a guy that usually comes up with plans.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001507.wav|7|100000|I don't just abandon people when they leave the TARDIS.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001508.wav|7|100000|The Jews, those in the work squads, thought at first...

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001510.wav|7|100000|What if Joan and Arthur cave to State and send her home?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001511.wav|7|100000|I think she wants me to rub olive oil on your taint.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001512.wav|7|100000|They were yelling at him, "Mr President, we need you to act!"
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001513.wav|7|100000|Yeah, in the 1920s a cat burglar named Nigel Hubbard left no fingerprints.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001514.wav|7|100000|- My father's had that book in a drawer since I was born.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001515.wav|7|100000|The risk of unpopular decision, competition, corruption, passivity, have prevented any action.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001516.wav|7|100000|I've always been a rational man with a great faith in science.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001517.wav|7|100000|If I had a big hollywood guy like you on my team,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001518.wav|7|100000|I don't think her boyfriend was too happy about her moving out.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001519.wav|7|100000|But this incident has helped me gain a new respect for him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001520.wav|7|100000|Why did you come with a pistol and point it at Tony?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001521.wav|7|100000|I realized I knew Herbert Gelman only after I'd heard his testimony.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001522.wav|7|100000|Meaningless words... you say, as you exhale to slow down the breath.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001523.wav|7|100000|L'm here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001524.wav|7|100000|But, but...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001525.wav|7|100000|Our classmate.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001526.wav|7|100000|- What, Colette?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001527.wav|7|100000|What's wrong?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001528.wav|7|100000|(GONG SOUNDING)
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001529.wav|7|100000|Let's talk.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001541.wav|7|100000|Do you need ammo, guns?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001542.wav|7|100000|Why are you still here?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001543.wav|7|100000|His bullets untraceable of course.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001544.wav|7|100000|- First, our hosts attacked us.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001545.wav|7|100000|Your hair is so pretty.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001546.wav|7|100000|Shall we arrange this way
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001547.wav|7|100000|Don't lie to me, Logan.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001548.wav|7|100000|I won't show any mercy!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001549.wav|7|100000|- Not a sound all night.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001550.wav|7|100000|And you will be crushed.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001551.wav|7|100000|I've been walking for miles.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001552.wav|7|100000|Yeah. I'm glad you weren't.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001553.wav|7|100000|My wedding can suck it?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001554.wav|7|100000|This isn't the real list.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001555.wav|7|100000|I'm too fast for TV.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001556.wav|7|100000|I got these shoes here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001557.wav|7|100000|The Tysons are here waiting.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001558.wav|7|100000|- take care of everything else.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001559.wav|7|100000|Give him a fucking mustache.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001560.wav|7|100000|That's enough of that horseshit.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001561.wav|7|100000|- He gave me the explosives.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001562.wav|7|100000|You're really good at that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001563.wav|7|100000|What time is that, exactly?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001574.wav|7|100000|I asked her if she would check Alan's cellphone for any recently made calls.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001575.wav|7|100000|I'm real glad we have six months together before you have to go to...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001576.wav|7|100000|What difference does it make if my wife was in on it or not?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001577.wav|7|100000|I just want to say I'm-I'm so honored that you're-you're doing this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001579.wav|7|100000|I am falling for you, Caroline, and I'm pretty sure you feel the same.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001580.wav|7|100000|What it meant to you Was still another chance to move closer to blake.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001581.wav|7|100000|Let's go to a pet shop tomorrow and get a new cat, all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001582.wav|7|100000|You insisted that you would not be left at Casterly Rock under any circumstances.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001583.wav|7|100000|I'm really hoping that you and I can move forward with my book, Julianne.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001584.wav|7|100000|You will call an outsider in the middle of the night and tell him...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001585.wav|7|100000|I know you think you're saving your people, but you need to stop this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001586.wav|7|100000|You probably aren't the sort of person who is cut out for manipulating others.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001587.wav|7|100000|The guy hanging naked from the shower curtain rod... half dead from autoerotic asphyxiation?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001588.wav|7|100000|Well, just don't use no sticks or no knives or no piece of iron.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001589.wav|7|100000|Because now he'll have to stay with these people for a long, long time.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001590.wav|7|100000|An impairment of set-background discrimination can get you into a heap of trouble.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001591.wav|7|100000|It made you write a book about the seven steps to heal the heart?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001592.wav|7|100000|I heard that Ibaragi Doji who lives in Senjo-ga-take is a demon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001593.wav|7|100000|I cannot imagine what they will do if the cache is not returned whole.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001595.wav|7|100000|If you came to say more cruel things to me, I'm going to bed.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001614.wav|7|100000|Easy on the gin, heavy on the tonic.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001615.wav|7|100000|I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001616.wav|7|100000|Peter Jennings and Tom Brokaw have bald spots!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001617.wav|7|100000|I'm not gonna inquire about that right now.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001618.wav|7|100000|I'm only a messenger, that must be obvious.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001619.wav|7|100000|But I never stopped to think about it
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001620.wav|7|100000|Did you see the eyes on that thing?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001621.wav|7|100000|And when I look back from a distance,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001622.wav|7|100000|You have nothing to return to in Stockholm.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001623.wav|7|100000|Look, I just need a few more minutes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001624.wav|7|100000|- Don, I can't seem to access this site.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001625.wav|7|100000|Don't you think his stomach is really big?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001626.wav|7|100000|What did you want them to be, wrong?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001627.wav|7|100000|Uh, I can't believe how fat I look.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001628.wav|7|100000|I bought it at piggly wiggly for 95 cents.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001629.wav|7|100000|When they rob you, you don't take money.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001630.wav|7|100000|They killed my boy and just drove on...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001631.wav|7|100000|Are you or are you not the Messiah?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001632.wav|7|100000|It was Eva Marie Saint and Sal Mineo.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001633.wav|7|100000|So let me put this simply for you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001634.wav|7|100000|- This medicine doesn't do a bit of good.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001635.wav|7|100000|Does everyone in your business talk like that?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001636.wav|7|100000|- Leave him alone!

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001638.wav|7|100000|- You see him?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001639.wav|7|100000|Sorry about that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001640.wav|7|100000|- Uh, this morning.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001641.wav|7|100000|- We'll get you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001642.wav|7|100000|I have supersperm!

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001644.wav|7|100000|Not this time.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001645.wav|7|100000|Yet firm too.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001646.wav|7|100000|Great distraction, man!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001648.wav|7|100000|I say we slip the message into one of the dog's collars, round up some fleas, put them on the dog.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001652.wav|7|100000|We got to stick together, until we know how to play him or until he slips up, then we get him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001657.wav|7|100000|If you wanna help the public and do your jobs best, sit quietly and listen to what I have to say.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001661.wav|7|100000|We just wanted to get married quietly, without any hoo-ha.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001662.wav|7|100000|Even if I don't know exactly what it is I do.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001663.wav|7|100000|Trouble is, Ann, when I'm standin' up my mind's lyin' down.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001664.wav|7|100000|Damn, if that don't feel like I got my balls back.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001665.wav|7|100000|All I know is that there is evil in the air..
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001666.wav|7|100000|And sooner or later we're gonna find where the money is.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001669.wav|7|100000|Well, my friend, all is not well on the hippie front.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001670.wav|7|100000|She's probably in black velvet with a feather in her hair.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001671.wav|7|100000|Tonight, I prefer to just dine in the shadows, thank you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001672.wav|7|100000|Sometimes the enemy of my enemy is my friend, Agent Gibbs.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001673.wav|7|100000|For not turning you back over to the marshals to hang.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001674.wav|7|100000|Just for what Master Wang has said, we are all Chinese.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001675.wav|7|100000|Um, can you call me back when you get this, please?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001676.wav|7|100000|So, is he the man of your life, or what happened?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001677.wav|7|100000|When white people see me coming into their store, they run.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001703.wav|7|100000|- It was Teru Mikami's own decision...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001704.wav|7|100000|Just when we need him most.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001705.wav|7|100000|You look like you've been crying.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001706.wav|7|100000|Oh, just a spare power cell.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001707.wav|7|100000|You don't want to marry him?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001708.wav|7|100000|Bobby, you're to remember this number.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001709.wav|7|100000|No one has to die here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001710.wav|7|100000|I have an audition on Friday.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001711.wav|7|100000|# You workin' that, you trickin' that
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001712.wav|7|100000|Have fun together while I'm gone.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001713.wav|7|100000|He was only good in crafts!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001714.wav|7|100000|I am not making an accusation.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001729.wav|7|100000|He's a man, who kills when he wants to, if I want to, no power on earth can stop me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001753.wav|7|100000|No, it--it--it sounds weird, but it was totally a spur-of-the-moment thing,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001755.wav|7|100000|No, it's just, uh, she caught me at Dad's yesterday, and she really laid into me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001756.wav|7|100000|Very much what everyone...first thing that comes into their mind when they think about me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001757.wav|7|100000|I just spent more and more time at the diner, trying to make the place work.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001758.wav|7|100000|You know, you should check into Mr. Hennessey and see what he was doing last night.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001759.wav|7|100000|I think he hid it in the mineshaft, which is about a half a mile north.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001760.wav|7|100000|Do you know that for a fact, or is that just what you want to believe?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001761.wav|7|100000|Look, Chuck is my boyfriend, and he makes $12 an hour, so you stay away from him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001762.wav|7|100000|Because they definitely want me back, and I wanna be able to have the freedom to...

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001772.wav|7|100000|Guys, my back hurts.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001773.wav|7|100000|What is going on?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001774.wav|7|100000|Garza's alibi checks out!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001775.wav|7|100000|No baby, come here.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001863.wav|7|4|I just wanted you to loosen up, have a good time - lt's okay.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001864.wav|7|4|I'm just going to agitate some of your molecules and split them apart.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001865.wav|7|4|None of this would have been possible if you hadn't trusted the Cylon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001866.wav|7|100000|- Fine, once I got 'em six bags of chips and some fresh air.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001867.wav|7|100000|It's sort of the Dukes of Hazzard method of avoiding the cops, so...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001868.wav|7|100000|Because you were talking with Vincent's wife.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001869.wav|7|100000|Do you wanna punish me right now?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001870.wav|7|100000|What are you playing at this time?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001871.wav|7|100000|Forget all this is out here sometimes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001872.wav|7|100000|What did you say your name was?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001873.wav|7|100000|But really, I admire you very much.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001874.wav|7|100000|You made my sister spit at me
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001875.wav|7|100000|- I expect you to tell the truth.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001876.wav|7|100000|And what is your period, Mr. Smart?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001877.wav|7|100000|Take the room next to hers, Sonja.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001878.wav|7|100000|I've had enough excitement for one life.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001879.wav|7|100000|And poor Mary, she was so scared.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001880.wav|7|100000|- Did you use that as bait so--
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001881.wav|7|100000|I know what dengue fever is like.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001882.wav|7|100000|But break it gently she is old ...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001883.wav|7|100000|We don't make anything off that one.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001884.wav|7|100000|- some manner of harm many moons ago.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001902.wav|7|100000|I slept with Jacob once when I had to go to his house to pick up my dogs.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001903.wav|7|100000|You know, I've been thinking, when you blew up your car back there, you blew up mine, too.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001905.wav|7|100000|I'm just going to go and talk to Daddy for a few minutes... and I'll be right back.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001907.wav|7|100000|I also built that library and used it to help a dozen guys get a high school diploma.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001908.wav|7|100000|No, that is an example of map... I've seen maps, certainly, that have my road on, for example.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001909.wav|7|100000|There are contractors that show up in pickup trucks, and they kind of watch you and surveil you.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001924.wav|7|100000|- I could have a thousand years with you, and it would still be too soon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001925.wav|7|100000|What is the reason you were in the desert so close to the Mexican border?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001926.wav|7|100000|Why does everyone feel the need to have these things, these, like, symbols of adulthood?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001927.wav|7|100000|We were supposed to go to Opera House in it and conduct a big raid.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001928.wav|7|100000|I've been keeping it a secret for months, and I'm going to stop hiding it.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001935.wav|7|100000|The world, you see, though it appears to be expanding infinitely, is truthfully quite small.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001936.wav|7|100000|- Yeah, an adult bear was milked half a dozen times, and then killed for this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001937.wav|7|100000|lot of lost souls took shepherd's call for blood seriously-- family values at its worst.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001938.wav|7|100000|Derek, I'd like to speak with your mom for a moment, is that all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001939.wav|7|100000|I'm Taylor's mother and I was just wondering if you created a fake profile online?

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001941.wav|7|100000|So, I told him I'd give him a quick B.J. If he laid off.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001954.wav|7|100000|Why don't we just get it all out in open?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001955.wav|7|100000|- If you don't like me, let's get him someone else.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001956.wav|7|100000|Frank's not a guy that usually comes up with plans.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001957.wav|7|100000|I don't just abandon people when they leave the TARDIS.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001958.wav|7|100000|The Jews, those in the work squads, thought at first...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001959.wav|7|100000|All he done was to recommend Demetrius to the bank.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001960.wav|7|100000|What if Joan and Arthur cave to State and send her home?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001961.wav|7|100000|I think she wants me to rub olive oil on your taint.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001962.wav|7|100000|They were yelling at him, "Mr President, we need you to act!"
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001963.wav|7|100000|Yeah, in the 1920s a cat burglar named Nigel Hubbard left no fingerprints.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001964.wav|7|100000|- My father's had that book in a drawer since I was born.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001966.wav|7|100000|I've always been a rational man with a great faith in science.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001967.wav|7|100000|If I had a big hollywood guy like you on my team,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001968.wav|7|100000|I don't think her boyfriend was too happy about her moving out.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001969.wav|7|100000|But this incident has helped me gain a new respect for him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001970.wav|7|100000|Why did you come with a pistol and point it at Tony?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001971.wav|7|100000|I realized I knew Herbert Gelman only after I'd heard his testimony.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001972.wav|7|100000|Meaningless words... you say, as you exhale to slow down the breath.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001973.wav|7|100000|L'm here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001974.wav|7|100000|But, but...

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001979.wav|7|100000|Let's talk.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001991.wav|7|100000|Do you need ammo, guns?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001992.wav|7|100000|Why are you still here?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001993.wav|7|100000|His bullets untraceable of course.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001994.wav|7|100000|- First, our hosts attacked us.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001995.wav|7|100000|Your hair is so pretty.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001996.wav|7|100000|Shall we arrange this way
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001997.wav|7|100000|Don't lie to me, Logan.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001998.wav|7|100000|I won't show any mercy!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_001999.wav|7|100000|- Not a sound all night.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002000.wav|7|100000|And you will be crushed.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002001.wav|7|100000|I've been walking for miles.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002002.wav|7|100000|Yeah. I'm glad you weren't.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002003.wav|7|100000|My wedding can suck it?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002004.wav|7|100000|This isn't the real list.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002005.wav|7|100000|I'm too fast for TV.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002006.wav|7|100000|I got these shoes here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002007.wav|7|100000|The Tysons are here waiting.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002008.wav|7|100000|- take care of everything else.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002009.wav|7|100000|Give him a fucking mustache.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002010.wav|7|100000|That's enough of that horseshit.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002011.wav|7|100000|- He gave me the explosives.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002012.wav|7|100000|You're really good at that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002013.wav|7|100000|What time is that, exactly?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002024.wav|7|100000|I asked her if she would check Alan's cellphone for any recently made calls.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002025.wav|7|100000|I'm real glad we have six months together before you have to go to...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002026.wav|7|100000|What difference does it make if my wife was in on it or not?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002027.wav|7|100000|I just want to say I'm-I'm so honored that you're-you're doing this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002029.wav|7|100000|I am falling for you, Caroline, and I'm pretty sure you feel the same.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002030.wav|7|100000|What it meant to you Was still another chance to move closer to blake.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002031.wav|7|100000|Let's go to a pet shop tomorrow and get a new cat, all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002032.wav|7|100000|You insisted that you would not be left at Casterly Rock under any circumstances.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002033.wav|7|100000|I'm really hoping that you and I can move forward with my book, Julianne.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002034.wav|7|100000|You will call an outsider in the middle of the night and tell him...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002035.wav|7|100000|I know you think you're saving your people, but you need to stop this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002036.wav|7|100000|You probably aren't the sort of person who is cut out for manipulating others.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002037.wav|7|100000|The guy hanging naked from the shower curtain rod... half dead from autoerotic asphyxiation?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002038.wav|7|100000|Well, just don't use no sticks or no knives or no piece of iron.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002039.wav|7|100000|Because now he'll have to stay with these people for a long, long time.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002040.wav|7|100000|An impairment of set-background discrimination can get you into a heap of trouble.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002041.wav|7|100000|It made you write a book about the seven steps to heal the heart?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002042.wav|7|100000|I heard that Ibaragi Doji who lives in Senjo-ga-take is a demon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002043.wav|7|100000|I cannot imagine what they will do if the cache is not returned whole.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002064.wav|7|100000|Easy on the gin, heavy on the tonic.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002065.wav|7|100000|I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002066.wav|7|100000|Peter Jennings and Tom Brokaw have bald spots!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002067.wav|7|100000|I'm not gonna inquire about that right now.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002068.wav|7|100000|I'm only a messenger, that must be obvious.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002069.wav|7|100000|But I never stopped to think about it
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002070.wav|7|100000|Did you see the eyes on that thing?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002071.wav|7|100000|And when I look back from a distance,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002072.wav|7|100000|You have nothing to return to in Stockholm.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002073.wav|7|100000|Look, I just need a few more minutes.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002075.wav|7|100000|Don't you think his stomach is really big?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002076.wav|7|100000|What did you want them to be, wrong?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002077.wav|7|100000|Uh, I can't believe how fat I look.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002078.wav|7|100000|I bought it at piggly wiggly for 95 cents.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002082.wav|7|100000|It was Eva Marie Saint and Sal Mineo.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002083.wav|7|100000|So let me put this simply for you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002084.wav|7|100000|- This medicine doesn't do a bit of good.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002085.wav|7|100000|Does everyone in your business talk like that?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002086.wav|7|100000|- Leave him alone!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002087.wav|7|100000|Small fucking towns.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002091.wav|7|100000|- We'll get you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002092.wav|7|100000|I have supersperm!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002093.wav|7|100000|2nd Platoon, listen up.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002094.wav|7|100000|Not this time.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002095.wav|7|100000|Yet firm too.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002096.wav|7|100000|Great distraction, man!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002098.wav|7|100000|I say we slip the message into one of the dog's collars, round up some fleas, put them on the dog.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002102.wav|7|100000|We got to stick together, until we know how to play him or until he slips up, then we get him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002107.wav|7|100000|If you wanna help the public and do your jobs best, sit quietly and listen to what I have to say.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002111.wav|7|100000|We just wanted to get married quietly, without any hoo-ha.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002112.wav|7|100000|Even if I don't know exactly what it is I do.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002113.wav|7|100000|Trouble is, Ann, when I'm standin' up my mind's lyin' down.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002114.wav|7|100000|Damn, if that don't feel like I got my balls back.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002115.wav|7|100000|All I know is that there is evil in the air..
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002116.wav|7|100000|And sooner or later we're gonna find where the money is.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002117.wav|7|100000|Mrs. Faber confessed to stabbing Rocco with her husband's knife once.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002118.wav|7|100000|You'll have to fill out a few of these forms, but...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002119.wav|7|100000|Well, my friend, all is not well on the hippie front.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002120.wav|7|100000|She's probably in black velvet with a feather in her hair.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002121.wav|7|100000|Tonight, I prefer to just dine in the shadows, thank you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002122.wav|7|100000|Sometimes the enemy of my enemy is my friend, Agent Gibbs.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002123.wav|7|100000|For not turning you back over to the marshals to hang.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002124.wav|7|100000|Just for what Master Wang has said, we are all Chinese.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002125.wav|7|100000|Um, can you call me back when you get this, please?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002126.wav|7|100000|So, is he the man of your life, or what happened?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002127.wav|7|100000|When white people see me coming into their store, they run.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002128.wav|7|100000|(GRUNTING)
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002129.wav|7|100000|Oh!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002130.wav|7|100000|Yes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002152.wav|7|100000|Venus cannot be her real name.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002153.wav|7|100000|- It was Teru Mikami's own decision...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002154.wav|7|100000|Just when we need him most.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002155.wav|7|100000|You look like you've been crying.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002156.wav|7|100000|Oh, just a spare power cell.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002157.wav|7|100000|You don't want to marry him?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002158.wav|7|100000|Bobby, you're to remember this number.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002159.wav|7|100000|No one has to die here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002160.wav|7|100000|I have an audition on Friday.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002161.wav|7|100000|# You workin' that, you trickin' that
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002162.wav|7|100000|Have fun together while I'm gone.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002163.wav|7|100000|He was only good in crafts!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002164.wav|7|100000|I am not making an accusation.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002179.wav|7|100000|He's a man, who kills when he wants to, if I want to, no power on earth can stop me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002203.wav|7|100000|No, it--it--it sounds weird, but it was totally a spur-of-the-moment thing,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002205.wav|7|100000|No, it's just, uh, she caught me at Dad's yesterday, and she really laid into me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002206.wav|7|100000|Very much what everyone...first thing that comes into their mind when they think about me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002207.wav|7|100000|I just spent more and more time at the diner, trying to make the place work.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002208.wav|7|100000|You know, you should check into Mr. Hennessey and see what he was doing last night.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002209.wav|7|100000|I think he hid it in the mineshaft, which is about a half a mile north.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002210.wav|7|100000|Do you know that for a fact, or is that just what you want to believe?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002211.wav|7|100000|Look, Chuck is my boyfriend, and he makes $12 an hour, so you stay away from him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002212.wav|7|100000|Because they definitely want me back, and I wanna be able to have the freedom to...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002213.wav|7|100000|We'll do a second line of resistance up there, on the hill, two hundred meters away.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002218.wav|7|100000|You can believe that!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002219.wav|7|100000|I'm looking for Pboo.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002220.wav|7|100000|Hayes at the plate.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002221.wav|7|100000|- Mister, you all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002222.wav|7|100000|Guys, my back hurts.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002223.wav|7|100000|What is going on?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002224.wav|7|100000|Garza's alibi checks out!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002225.wav|7|100000|No baby, come here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002226.wav|7|100000|Come watch the show.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002227.wav|7|100000|BIRTH CERTIFICATE - FATHER UNKNOWN
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002228.wav|7|100000|Let me see that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0007_002229.wav|7|100000|And then I'm frightened.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000063.wav|8|0|I just wanted you to loosen up, have a good time - lt's okay.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000064.wav|8|0|I'm just going to agitate some of your molecules and split them apart.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000065.wav|8|0|None of this would have been possible if you hadn't trusted the Cylon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000066.wav|8|100000|- Fine, once I got 'em six bags of chips and some fresh air.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000067.wav|8|100000|It's sort of the Dukes of Hazzard method of avoiding the cops, so...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000068.wav|8|100000|Because you were talking with Vincent's wife.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000069.wav|8|100000|Do you wanna punish me right now?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000070.wav|8|100000|What are you playing at this time?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000071.wav|8|100000|Forget all this is out here sometimes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000072.wav|8|100000|What did you say your name was?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000073.wav|8|100000|But really, I admire you very much.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000074.wav|8|100000|You made my sister spit at me
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000075.wav|8|100000|- I expect you to tell the truth.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000076.wav|8|100000|And what is your period, Mr. Smart?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000077.wav|8|100000|Take the room next to hers, Sonja.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000078.wav|8|100000|I've had enough excitement for one life.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000079.wav|8|100000|And poor Mary, she was so scared.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000080.wav|8|100000|- Did you use that as bait so--
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000081.wav|8|100000|I know what dengue fever is like.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000082.wav|8|100000|But break it gently she is old ...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000083.wav|8|100000|We don't make anything off that one.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000084.wav|8|100000|- some manner of harm many moons ago.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000085.wav|8|100000|Hey, o'neill, hand me a bear claw.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000101.wav|8|100000|What they do... is they will sit up in this higher energy state... and then drop down again.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000102.wav|8|100000|I slept with Jacob once when I had to go to his house to pick up my dogs.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000103.wav|8|100000|You know, I've been thinking, when you blew up your car back there, you blew up mine, too.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000105.wav|8|100000|I'm just going to go and talk to Daddy for a few minutes... and I'll be right back.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000107.wav|8|100000|I also built that library and used it to help a dozen guys get a high school diploma.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000108.wav|8|100000|No, that is an example of map... I've seen maps, certainly, that have my road on, for example.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000109.wav|8|100000|There are contractors that show up in pickup trucks, and they kind of watch you and surveil you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000122.wav|8|100000|Rest those little bones, while I go out and make a goddamn fool of myself.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000123.wav|8|100000|I can get you an achilles tendon in South Korea for anywhere between $200 and $1,200 dollars.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000124.wav|8|100000|- I could have a thousand years with you, and it would still be too soon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000125.wav|8|100000|What is the reason you were in the desert so close to the Mexican border?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000126.wav|8|100000|Why does everyone feel the need to have these things, these, like, symbols of adulthood?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000127.wav|8|100000|We were supposed to go to Opera House in it and conduct a big raid.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000128.wav|8|100000|I've been keeping it a secret for months, and I'm going to stop hiding it.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000129.wav|8|100000|At the end of the month, I get a bonus, 10% of anything the horses make.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000130.wav|8|100000|The other two were floating in the hotel pool, and they weren't doing the backstroke.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000131.wav|8|100000|You know, I should've just done the full nickel the first time you busted me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000132.wav|8|100000|That guy's got two heads, a foot of reach on us, and no blind spot.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000133.wav|8|100000|One's the Bible, one's a book on Christmas... one's on how to be a carpenter.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000134.wav|8|100000|The safety of every man here rests with me, Caulder, and I can't trust you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000135.wav|8|100000|The world, you see, though it appears to be expanding infinitely, is truthfully quite small.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000136.wav|8|100000|- Yeah, an adult bear was milked half a dozen times, and then killed for this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000137.wav|8|100000|lot of lost souls took shepherd's call for blood seriously-- family values at its worst.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000138.wav|8|100000|Derek, I'd like to speak with your mom for a moment, is that all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000139.wav|8|100000|I'm Taylor's mother and I was just wondering if you created a fake profile online?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000140.wav|8|100000|Every time Brandon has a blow-up it's, like, always pointed at a stronger woman.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000141.wav|8|100000|So, I told him I'd give him a quick B.J. If he laid off.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000142.wav|8|100000|"Next day it was back to life back to reality"
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000143.wav|8|100000|I object to working on this case on moral grounds.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000147.wav|8|100000|Do me a favor, I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000148.wav|8|100000|I should get my dad a new pair of shoes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000149.wav|8|100000|Am I gonna have to hear this from you, too?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000150.wav|8|100000|Sark has demanded that you open her coffin for him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000151.wav|8|100000|Don't be so chatty, have your drink and move on.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000154.wav|8|100000|Why don't we just get it all out in open?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000155.wav|8|100000|- If you don't like me, let's get him someone else.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000156.wav|8|100000|Frank's not a guy that usually comes up with plans.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000157.wav|8|100000|I don't just abandon people when they leave the TARDIS.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000158.wav|8|100000|The Jews, those in the work squads, thought at first...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000159.wav|8|100000|All he done was to recommend Demetrius to the bank.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000160.wav|8|100000|What if Joan and Arthur cave to State and send her home?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000161.wav|8|100000|I think she wants me to rub olive oil on your taint.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000162.wav|8|100000|They were yelling at him, "Mr President, we need you to act!"
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000163.wav|8|100000|Yeah, in the 1920s a cat burglar named Nigel Hubbard left no fingerprints.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000164.wav|8|100000|- My father's had that book in a drawer since I was born.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000167.wav|8|100000|If I had a big hollywood guy like you on my team,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000168.wav|8|100000|I don't think her boyfriend was too happy about her moving out.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000169.wav|8|100000|But this incident has helped me gain a new respect for him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000170.wav|8|100000|Why did you come with a pistol and point it at Tony?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000171.wav|8|100000|I realized I knew Herbert Gelman only after I'd heard his testimony.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000172.wav|8|100000|Meaningless words... you say, as you exhale to slow down the breath.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000173.wav|8|100000|L'm here.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000192.wav|8|100000|Why are you still here?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000193.wav|8|100000|His bullets untraceable of course.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000194.wav|8|100000|- First, our hosts attacked us.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000195.wav|8|100000|Your hair is so pretty.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000196.wav|8|100000|Shall we arrange this way
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000197.wav|8|100000|Don't lie to me, Logan.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000198.wav|8|100000|I won't show any mercy!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000199.wav|8|100000|- Not a sound all night.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000200.wav|8|100000|And you will be crushed.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000201.wav|8|100000|I've been walking for miles.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000202.wav|8|100000|Yeah. I'm glad you weren't.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000203.wav|8|100000|My wedding can suck it?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000204.wav|8|100000|This isn't the real list.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000205.wav|8|100000|I'm too fast for TV.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000206.wav|8|100000|I got these shoes here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000207.wav|8|100000|The Tysons are here waiting.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000208.wav|8|100000|- take care of everything else.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000209.wav|8|100000|Give him a fucking mustache.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000210.wav|8|100000|That's enough of that horseshit.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000211.wav|8|100000|- He gave me the explosives.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000212.wav|8|100000|You're really good at that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000213.wav|8|100000|What time is that, exactly?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000224.wav|8|100000|I asked her if she would check Alan's cellphone for any recently made calls.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000225.wav|8|100000|I'm real glad we have six months together before you have to go to...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000226.wav|8|100000|What difference does it make if my wife was in on it or not?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000227.wav|8|100000|I just want to say I'm-I'm so honored that you're-you're doing this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000229.wav|8|100000|I am falling for you, Caroline, and I'm pretty sure you feel the same.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000230.wav|8|100000|What it meant to you Was still another chance to move closer to blake.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000231.wav|8|100000|Let's go to a pet shop tomorrow and get a new cat, all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000232.wav|8|100000|You insisted that you would not be left at Casterly Rock under any circumstances.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000233.wav|8|100000|I'm really hoping that you and I can move forward with my book, Julianne.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000234.wav|8|100000|You will call an outsider in the middle of the night and tell him...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000235.wav|8|100000|I know you think you're saving your people, but you need to stop this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000236.wav|8|100000|You probably aren't the sort of person who is cut out for manipulating others.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000237.wav|8|100000|The guy hanging naked from the shower curtain rod... half dead from autoerotic asphyxiation?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000238.wav|8|100000|Well, just don't use no sticks or no knives or no piece of iron.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000239.wav|8|100000|Because now he'll have to stay with these people for a long, long time.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000240.wav|8|100000|An impairment of set-background discrimination can get you into a heap of trouble.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000241.wav|8|100000|It made you write a book about the seven steps to heal the heart?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000242.wav|8|100000|I heard that Ibaragi Doji who lives in Senjo-ga-take is a demon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000243.wav|8|100000|I cannot imagine what they will do if the cache is not returned whole.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000244.wav|8|100000|We would love to save your princess, but are looking for two royal geeks.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000245.wav|8|100000|If you came to say more cruel things to me, I'm going to bed.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000264.wav|8|100000|Easy on the gin, heavy on the tonic.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000265.wav|8|100000|I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000266.wav|8|100000|Peter Jennings and Tom Brokaw have bald spots!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000267.wav|8|100000|I'm not gonna inquire about that right now.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000268.wav|8|100000|I'm only a messenger, that must be obvious.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000269.wav|8|100000|But I never stopped to think about it
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000270.wav|8|100000|Did you see the eyes on that thing?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000271.wav|8|100000|And when I look back from a distance,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000272.wav|8|100000|You have nothing to return to in Stockholm.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000273.wav|8|100000|Look, I just need a few more minutes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000274.wav|8|100000|- Don, I can't seem to access this site.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000275.wav|8|100000|Don't you think his stomach is really big?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000276.wav|8|100000|What did you want them to be, wrong?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000277.wav|8|100000|Uh, I can't believe how fat I look.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000278.wav|8|100000|I bought it at piggly wiggly for 95 cents.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000279.wav|8|100000|When they rob you, you don't take money.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000280.wav|8|100000|They killed my boy and just drove on...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000281.wav|8|100000|Are you or are you not the Messiah?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000282.wav|8|100000|It was Eva Marie Saint and Sal Mineo.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000283.wav|8|100000|So let me put this simply for you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000284.wav|8|100000|- This medicine doesn't do a bit of good.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000285.wav|8|100000|Does everyone in your business talk like that?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000286.wav|8|100000|- Leave him alone!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000287.wav|8|100000|Small fucking towns.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000288.wav|8|100000|- You see him?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000289.wav|8|100000|Sorry about that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000290.wav|8|100000|- Uh, this morning.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000291.wav|8|100000|- We'll get you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000292.wav|8|100000|I have supersperm!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000293.wav|8|100000|2nd Platoon, listen up.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000294.wav|8|100000|Not this time.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000295.wav|8|100000|Yet firm too.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000296.wav|8|100000|Great distraction, man!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000298.wav|8|100000|I say we slip the message into one of the dog's collars, round up some fleas, put them on the dog.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000302.wav|8|100000|We got to stick together, until we know how to play him or until he slips up, then we get him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000307.wav|8|100000|If you wanna help the public and do your jobs best, sit quietly and listen to what I have to say.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000311.wav|8|100000|We just wanted to get married quietly, without any hoo-ha.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000312.wav|8|100000|Even if I don't know exactly what it is I do.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000313.wav|8|100000|Trouble is, Ann, when I'm standin' up my mind's lyin' down.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000314.wav|8|100000|Damn, if that don't feel like I got my balls back.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000315.wav|8|100000|All I know is that there is evil in the air..
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000316.wav|8|100000|And sooner or later we're gonna find where the money is.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000317.wav|8|100000|Mrs. Faber confessed to stabbing Rocco with her husband's knife once.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000318.wav|8|100000|You'll have to fill out a few of these forms, but...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000319.wav|8|100000|Well, my friend, all is not well on the hippie front.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000320.wav|8|100000|She's probably in black velvet with a feather in her hair.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000321.wav|8|100000|Tonight, I prefer to just dine in the shadows, thank you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000322.wav|8|100000|Sometimes the enemy of my enemy is my friend, Agent Gibbs.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000323.wav|8|100000|For not turning you back over to the marshals to hang.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000324.wav|8|100000|Just for what Master Wang has said, we are all Chinese.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000325.wav|8|100000|Um, can you call me back when you get this, please?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000326.wav|8|100000|So, is he the man of your life, or what happened?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000327.wav|8|100000|When white people see me coming into their store, they run.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000328.wav|8|100000|(GRUNTING)
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000329.wav|8|100000|Oh!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000330.wav|8|100000|Yes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000352.wav|8|100000|Venus cannot be her real name.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000353.wav|8|100000|- It was Teru Mikami's own decision...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000354.wav|8|100000|Just when we need him most.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000355.wav|8|100000|You look like you've been crying.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000356.wav|8|100000|Oh, just a spare power cell.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000357.wav|8|100000|You don't want to marry him?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000358.wav|8|100000|Bobby, you're to remember this number.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000359.wav|8|100000|No one has to die here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000360.wav|8|100000|I have an audition on Friday.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000361.wav|8|100000|# You workin' that, you trickin' that
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000362.wav|8|100000|Have fun together while I'm gone.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000363.wav|8|100000|He was only good in crafts!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000364.wav|8|100000|I am not making an accusation.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000379.wav|8|100000|He's a man, who kills when he wants to, if I want to, no power on earth can stop me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000403.wav|8|100000|No, it--it--it sounds weird, but it was totally a spur-of-the-moment thing,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000405.wav|8|100000|No, it's just, uh, she caught me at Dad's yesterday, and she really laid into me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000406.wav|8|100000|Very much what everyone...first thing that comes into their mind when they think about me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000407.wav|8|100000|I just spent more and more time at the diner, trying to make the place work.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000408.wav|8|100000|You know, you should check into Mr. Hennessey and see what he was doing last night.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000409.wav|8|100000|I think he hid it in the mineshaft, which is about a half a mile north.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000410.wav|8|100000|Do you know that for a fact, or is that just what you want to believe?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000411.wav|8|100000|Look, Chuck is my boyfriend, and he makes $12 an hour, so you stay away from him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000412.wav|8|100000|Because they definitely want me back, and I wanna be able to have the freedom to...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000413.wav|8|100000|We'll do a second line of resistance up there, on the hill, two hundred meters away.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000418.wav|8|100000|You can believe that!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000419.wav|8|100000|I'm looking for Pboo.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000420.wav|8|100000|Hayes at the plate.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000421.wav|8|100000|- Mister, you all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000422.wav|8|100000|Guys, my back hurts.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000423.wav|8|100000|What is going on?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000424.wav|8|100000|Garza's alibi checks out!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000425.wav|8|100000|No baby, come here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000426.wav|8|100000|Come watch the show.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000429.wav|8|100000|And then I'm frightened.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000513.wav|8|1|I just wanted you to loosen up, have a good time - lt's okay.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000514.wav|8|1|I'm just going to agitate some of your molecules and split them apart.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000515.wav|8|1|None of this would have been possible if you hadn't trusted the Cylon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000516.wav|8|100000|- Fine, once I got 'em six bags of chips and some fresh air.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000517.wav|8|100000|It's sort of the Dukes of Hazzard method of avoiding the cops, so...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000518.wav|8|100000|Because you were talking with Vincent's wife.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000519.wav|8|100000|Do you wanna punish me right now?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000520.wav|8|100000|What are you playing at this time?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000521.wav|8|100000|Forget all this is out here sometimes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000522.wav|8|100000|What did you say your name was?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000523.wav|8|100000|But really, I admire you very much.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000524.wav|8|100000|You made my sister spit at me
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000525.wav|8|100000|- I expect you to tell the truth.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000526.wav|8|100000|And what is your period, Mr. Smart?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000527.wav|8|100000|Take the room next to hers, Sonja.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000528.wav|8|100000|I've had enough excitement for one life.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000529.wav|8|100000|And poor Mary, she was so scared.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000530.wav|8|100000|- Did you use that as bait so--
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000531.wav|8|100000|I know what dengue fever is like.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000532.wav|8|100000|But break it gently she is old ...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000533.wav|8|100000|We don't make anything off that one.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000534.wav|8|100000|- some manner of harm many moons ago.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000772.wav|8|100000|Sometimes the enemy of my enemy is my friend, Agent Gibbs.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000773.wav|8|100000|For not turning you back over to the marshals to hang.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000774.wav|8|100000|Just for what Master Wang has said, we are all Chinese.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000775.wav|8|100000|Um, can you call me back when you get this, please?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000776.wav|8|100000|So, is he the man of your life, or what happened?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000777.wav|8|100000|When white people see me coming into their store, they run.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000780.wav|8|100000|Yes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000802.wav|8|100000|Venus cannot be her real name.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000803.wav|8|100000|- It was Teru Mikami's own decision...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000804.wav|8|100000|Just when we need him most.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000805.wav|8|100000|You look like you've been crying.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000806.wav|8|100000|Oh, just a spare power cell.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000807.wav|8|100000|You don't want to marry him?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000808.wav|8|100000|Bobby, you're to remember this number.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000809.wav|8|100000|No one has to die here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000810.wav|8|100000|I have an audition on Friday.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000811.wav|8|100000|# You workin' that, you trickin' that
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000812.wav|8|100000|Have fun together while I'm gone.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000813.wav|8|100000|He was only good in crafts!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000814.wav|8|100000|I am not making an accusation.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000829.wav|8|100000|He's a man, who kills when he wants to, if I want to, no power on earth can stop me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000853.wav|8|100000|No, it--it--it sounds weird, but it was totally a spur-of-the-moment thing,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000855.wav|8|100000|No, it's just, uh, she caught me at Dad's yesterday, and she really laid into me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000856.wav|8|100000|Very much what everyone...first thing that comes into their mind when they think about me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000857.wav|8|100000|I just spent more and more time at the diner, trying to make the place work.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000858.wav|8|100000|You know, you should check into Mr. Hennessey and see what he was doing last night.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000859.wav|8|100000|I think he hid it in the mineshaft, which is about a half a mile north.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000860.wav|8|100000|Do you know that for a fact, or is that just what you want to believe?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000861.wav|8|100000|Look, Chuck is my boyfriend, and he makes $12 an hour, so you stay away from him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000862.wav|8|100000|Because they definitely want me back, and I wanna be able to have the freedom to...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000863.wav|8|100000|We'll do a second line of resistance up there, on the hill, two hundred meters away.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000868.wav|8|100000|You can believe that!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000869.wav|8|100000|I'm looking for Pboo.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000871.wav|8|100000|- Mister, you all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000872.wav|8|100000|Guys, my back hurts.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000873.wav|8|100000|What is going on?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000874.wav|8|100000|Garza's alibi checks out!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000875.wav|8|100000|No baby, come here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000876.wav|8|100000|Come watch the show.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000877.wav|8|100000|BIRTH CERTIFICATE - FATHER UNKNOWN
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000878.wav|8|100000|Let me see that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000879.wav|8|100000|And then I'm frightened.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000963.wav|8|2|I just wanted you to loosen up, have a good time - lt's okay.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000964.wav|8|2|I'm just going to agitate some of your molecules and split them apart.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000965.wav|8|2|None of this would have been possible if you hadn't trusted the Cylon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000966.wav|8|100000|- Fine, once I got 'em six bags of chips and some fresh air.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000967.wav|8|100000|It's sort of the Dukes of Hazzard method of avoiding the cops, so...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000968.wav|8|100000|Because you were talking with Vincent's wife.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000969.wav|8|100000|Do you wanna punish me right now?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000970.wav|8|100000|What are you playing at this time?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000971.wav|8|100000|Forget all this is out here sometimes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000972.wav|8|100000|What did you say your name was?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000973.wav|8|100000|But really, I admire you very much.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000974.wav|8|100000|You made my sister spit at me
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000975.wav|8|100000|- I expect you to tell the truth.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000976.wav|8|100000|And what is your period, Mr. Smart?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000977.wav|8|100000|Take the room next to hers, Sonja.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000978.wav|8|100000|I've had enough excitement for one life.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000979.wav|8|100000|And poor Mary, she was so scared.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000980.wav|8|100000|- Did you use that as bait so--
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000981.wav|8|100000|I know what dengue fever is like.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000982.wav|8|100000|But break it gently she is old ...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000983.wav|8|100000|We don't make anything off that one.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000984.wav|8|100000|- some manner of harm many moons ago.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001001.wav|8|100000|What they do... is they will sit up in this higher energy state... and then drop down again.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001002.wav|8|100000|I slept with Jacob once when I had to go to his house to pick up my dogs.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001003.wav|8|100000|You know, I've been thinking, when you blew up your car back there, you blew up mine, too.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001005.wav|8|100000|I'm just going to go and talk to Daddy for a few minutes... and I'll be right back.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001007.wav|8|100000|I also built that library and used it to help a dozen guys get a high school diploma.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001008.wav|8|100000|No, that is an example of map... I've seen maps, certainly, that have my road on, for example.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001009.wav|8|100000|There are contractors that show up in pickup trucks, and they kind of watch you and surveil you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001022.wav|8|100000|Rest those little bones, while I go out and make a goddamn fool of myself.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001023.wav|8|100000|I can get you an achilles tendon in South Korea for anywhere between $200 and $1,200 dollars.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001024.wav|8|100000|- I could have a thousand years with you, and it would still be too soon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001025.wav|8|100000|What is the reason you were in the desert so close to the Mexican border?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001026.wav|8|100000|Why does everyone feel the need to have these things, these, like, symbols of adulthood?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001027.wav|8|100000|We were supposed to go to Opera House in it and conduct a big raid.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001028.wav|8|100000|I've been keeping it a secret for months, and I'm going to stop hiding it.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001029.wav|8|100000|At the end of the month, I get a bonus, 10% of anything the horses make.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001030.wav|8|100000|The other two were floating in the hotel pool, and they weren't doing the backstroke.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001031.wav|8|100000|You know, I should've just done the full nickel the first time you busted me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001032.wav|8|100000|That guy's got two heads, a foot of reach on us, and no blind spot.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001033.wav|8|100000|One's the Bible, one's a book on Christmas... one's on how to be a carpenter.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001034.wav|8|100000|The safety of every man here rests with me, Caulder, and I can't trust you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001035.wav|8|100000|The world, you see, though it appears to be expanding infinitely, is truthfully quite small.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001036.wav|8|100000|- Yeah, an adult bear was milked half a dozen times, and then killed for this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001037.wav|8|100000|lot of lost souls took shepherd's call for blood seriously-- family values at its worst.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001038.wav|8|100000|Derek, I'd like to speak with your mom for a moment, is that all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001039.wav|8|100000|I'm Taylor's mother and I was just wondering if you created a fake profile online?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001040.wav|8|100000|Every time Brandon has a blow-up it's, like, always pointed at a stronger woman.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001041.wav|8|100000|So, I told him I'd give him a quick B.J. If he laid off.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001043.wav|8|100000|I object to working on this case on moral grounds.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001047.wav|8|100000|Do me a favor, I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001048.wav|8|100000|I should get my dad a new pair of shoes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001049.wav|8|100000|Am I gonna have to hear this from you, too?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001050.wav|8|100000|Sark has demanded that you open her coffin for him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001051.wav|8|100000|Don't be so chatty, have your drink and move on.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001054.wav|8|100000|Why don't we just get it all out in open?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001055.wav|8|100000|- If you don't like me, let's get him someone else.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001056.wav|8|100000|Frank's not a guy that usually comes up with plans.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001057.wav|8|100000|I don't just abandon people when they leave the TARDIS.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001058.wav|8|100000|The Jews, those in the work squads, thought at first...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001059.wav|8|100000|All he done was to recommend Demetrius to the bank.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001060.wav|8|100000|What if Joan and Arthur cave to State and send her home?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001061.wav|8|100000|I think she wants me to rub olive oil on your taint.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001062.wav|8|100000|They were yelling at him, "Mr President, we need you to act!"
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001063.wav|8|100000|Yeah, in the 1920s a cat burglar named Nigel Hubbard left no fingerprints.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001064.wav|8|100000|- My father's had that book in a drawer since I was born.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001067.wav|8|100000|If I had a big hollywood guy like you on my team,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001068.wav|8|100000|I don't think her boyfriend was too happy about her moving out.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001069.wav|8|100000|But this incident has helped me gain a new respect for him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001070.wav|8|100000|Why did you come with a pistol and point it at Tony?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001071.wav|8|100000|I realized I knew Herbert Gelman only after I'd heard his testimony.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001072.wav|8|100000|Meaningless words... you say, as you exhale to slow down the breath.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001073.wav|8|100000|L'm here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001074.wav|8|100000|But, but...

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001079.wav|8|100000|Let's talk.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001091.wav|8|100000|Do you need ammo, guns?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001092.wav|8|100000|Why are you still here?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001093.wav|8|100000|His bullets untraceable of course.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001094.wav|8|100000|- First, our hosts attacked us.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001095.wav|8|100000|Your hair is so pretty.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001096.wav|8|100000|Shall we arrange this way
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001097.wav|8|100000|Don't lie to me, Logan.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001098.wav|8|100000|I won't show any mercy!

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001100.wav|8|100000|And you will be crushed.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001101.wav|8|100000|I've been walking for miles.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001102.wav|8|100000|Yeah. I'm glad you weren't.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001103.wav|8|100000|My wedding can suck it?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001104.wav|8|100000|This isn't the real list.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001105.wav|8|100000|I'm too fast for TV.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001106.wav|8|100000|I got these shoes here.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001108.wav|8|100000|- take care of everything else.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001109.wav|8|100000|Give him a fucking mustache.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001110.wav|8|100000|That's enough of that horseshit.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001111.wav|8|100000|- He gave me the explosives.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001112.wav|8|100000|You're really good at that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001113.wav|8|100000|What time is that, exactly?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001124.wav|8|100000|I asked her if she would check Alan's cellphone for any recently made calls.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001125.wav|8|100000|I'm real glad we have six months together before you have to go to...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001126.wav|8|100000|What difference does it make if my wife was in on it or not?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001127.wav|8|100000|I just want to say I'm-I'm so honored that you're-you're doing this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001129.wav|8|100000|I am falling for you, Caroline, and I'm pretty sure you feel the same.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001130.wav|8|100000|What it meant to you Was still another chance to move closer to blake.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001131.wav|8|100000|Let's go to a pet shop tomorrow and get a new cat, all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001132.wav|8|100000|You insisted that you would not be left at Casterly Rock under any circumstances.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001133.wav|8|100000|I'm really hoping that you and I can move forward with my book, Julianne.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001134.wav|8|100000|You will call an outsider in the middle of the night and tell him...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001135.wav|8|100000|I know you think you're saving your people, but you need to stop this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001136.wav|8|100000|You probably aren't the sort of person who is cut out for manipulating others.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001137.wav|8|100000|The guy hanging naked from the shower curtain rod... half dead from autoerotic asphyxiation?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001138.wav|8|100000|Well, just don't use no sticks or no knives or no piece of iron.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001139.wav|8|100000|Because now he'll have to stay with these people for a long, long time.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001140.wav|8|100000|An impairment of set-background discrimination can get you into a heap of trouble.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001141.wav|8|100000|It made you write a book about the seven steps to heal the heart?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001142.wav|8|100000|I heard that Ibaragi Doji who lives in Senjo-ga-take is a demon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001143.wav|8|100000|I cannot imagine what they will do if the cache is not returned whole.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001144.wav|8|100000|We would love to save your princess, but are looking for two royal geeks.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001145.wav|8|100000|If you came to say more cruel things to me, I'm going to bed.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001164.wav|8|100000|Easy on the gin, heavy on the tonic.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001165.wav|8|100000|I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001166.wav|8|100000|Peter Jennings and Tom Brokaw have bald spots!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001167.wav|8|100000|I'm not gonna inquire about that right now.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001168.wav|8|100000|I'm only a messenger, that must be obvious.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001169.wav|8|100000|But I never stopped to think about it
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001170.wav|8|100000|Did you see the eyes on that thing?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001171.wav|8|100000|And when I look back from a distance,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001172.wav|8|100000|You have nothing to return to in Stockholm.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001173.wav|8|100000|Look, I just need a few more minutes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001174.wav|8|100000|- Don, I can't seem to access this site.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001175.wav|8|100000|Don't you think his stomach is really big?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001176.wav|8|100000|What did you want them to be, wrong?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001177.wav|8|100000|Uh, I can't believe how fat I look.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001178.wav|8|100000|I bought it at piggly wiggly for 95 cents.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001179.wav|8|100000|When they rob you, you don't take money.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001180.wav|8|100000|They killed my boy and just drove on...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001181.wav|8|100000|Are you or are you not the Messiah?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001182.wav|8|100000|It was Eva Marie Saint and Sal Mineo.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001183.wav|8|100000|So let me put this simply for you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001184.wav|8|100000|- This medicine doesn't do a bit of good.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001185.wav|8|100000|Does everyone in your business talk like that?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001186.wav|8|100000|- Leave him alone!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001187.wav|8|100000|Small fucking towns.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001188.wav|8|100000|- You see him?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001189.wav|8|100000|Sorry about that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001190.wav|8|100000|- Uh, this morning.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001191.wav|8|100000|- We'll get you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001192.wav|8|100000|I have supersperm!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001193.wav|8|100000|2nd Platoon, listen up.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001194.wav|8|100000|Not this time.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001195.wav|8|100000|Yet firm too.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001196.wav|8|100000|Great distraction, man!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001198.wav|8|100000|I say we slip the message into one of the dog's collars, round up some fleas, put them on the dog.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001202.wav|8|100000|We got to stick together, until we know how to play him or until he slips up, then we get him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001207.wav|8|100000|If you wanna help the public and do your jobs best, sit quietly and listen to what I have to say.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001211.wav|8|100000|We just wanted to get married quietly, without any hoo-ha.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001212.wav|8|100000|Even if I don't know exactly what it is I do.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001213.wav|8|100000|Trouble is, Ann, when I'm standin' up my mind's lyin' down.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001214.wav|8|100000|Damn, if that don't feel like I got my balls back.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001215.wav|8|100000|All I know is that there is evil in the air..
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001216.wav|8|100000|And sooner or later we're gonna find where the money is.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001217.wav|8|100000|Mrs. Faber confessed to stabbing Rocco with her husband's knife once.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001218.wav|8|100000|You'll have to fill out a few of these forms, but...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001219.wav|8|100000|Well, my friend, all is not well on the hippie front.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001220.wav|8|100000|She's probably in black velvet with a feather in her hair.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001221.wav|8|100000|Tonight, I prefer to just dine in the shadows, thank you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001222.wav|8|100000|Sometimes the enemy of my enemy is my friend, Agent Gibbs.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001223.wav|8|100000|For not turning you back over to the marshals to hang.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001224.wav|8|100000|Just for what Master Wang has said, we are all Chinese.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001225.wav|8|100000|Um, can you call me back when you get this, please?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001226.wav|8|100000|So, is he the man of your life, or what happened?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001227.wav|8|100000|When white people see me coming into their store, they run.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001228.wav|8|100000|(GRUNTING)
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001229.wav|8|100000|Oh!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001230.wav|8|100000|Yes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001252.wav|8|100000|Venus cannot be her real name.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001253.wav|8|100000|- It was Teru Mikami's own decision...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001254.wav|8|100000|Just when we need him most.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001255.wav|8|100000|You look like you've been crying.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001256.wav|8|100000|Oh, just a spare power cell.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001257.wav|8|100000|You don't want to marry him?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001258.wav|8|100000|Bobby, you're to remember this number.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001259.wav|8|100000|No one has to die here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001260.wav|8|100000|I have an audition on Friday.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001261.wav|8|100000|# You workin' that, you trickin' that
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001262.wav|8|100000|Have fun together while I'm gone.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001263.wav|8|100000|He was only good in crafts!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001264.wav|8|100000|I am not making an accusation.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001279.wav|8|100000|He's a man, who kills when he wants to, if I want to, no power on earth can stop me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001303.wav|8|100000|No, it--it--it sounds weird, but it was totally a spur-of-the-moment thing,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001305.wav|8|100000|No, it's just, uh, she caught me at Dad's yesterday, and she really laid into me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001306.wav|8|100000|Very much what everyone...first thing that comes into their mind when they think about me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001307.wav|8|100000|I just spent more and more time at the diner, trying to make the place work.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001308.wav|8|100000|You know, you should check into Mr. Hennessey and see what he was doing last night.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001309.wav|8|100000|I think he hid it in the mineshaft, which is about a half a mile north.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001310.wav|8|100000|Do you know that for a fact, or is that just what you want to believe?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001311.wav|8|100000|Look, Chuck is my boyfriend, and he makes $12 an hour, so you stay away from him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001312.wav|8|100000|Because they definitely want me back, and I wanna be able to have the freedom to...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001313.wav|8|100000|We'll do a second line of resistance up there, on the hill, two hundred meters away.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001318.wav|8|100000|You can believe that!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001319.wav|8|100000|I'm looking for Pboo.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001320.wav|8|100000|Hayes at the plate.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001321.wav|8|100000|- Mister, you all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001322.wav|8|100000|Guys, my back hurts.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001323.wav|8|100000|What is going on?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001324.wav|8|100000|Garza's alibi checks out!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001325.wav|8|100000|No baby, come here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001326.wav|8|100000|Come watch the show.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001327.wav|8|100000|BIRTH CERTIFICATE - FATHER UNKNOWN
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001328.wav|8|100000|Let me see that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001329.wav|8|100000|And then I'm frightened.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001413.wav|8|3|I just wanted you to loosen up, have a good time - lt's okay.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001414.wav|8|3|I'm just going to agitate some of your molecules and split them apart.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001415.wav|8|3|None of this would have been possible if you hadn't trusted the Cylon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001416.wav|8|100000|- Fine, once I got 'em six bags of chips and some fresh air.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001417.wav|8|100000|It's sort of the Dukes of Hazzard method of avoiding the cops, so...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001418.wav|8|100000|Because you were talking with Vincent's wife.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001419.wav|8|100000|Do you wanna punish me right now?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001420.wav|8|100000|What are you playing at this time?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001421.wav|8|100000|Forget all this is out here sometimes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001422.wav|8|100000|What did you say your name was?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001423.wav|8|100000|But really, I admire you very much.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001424.wav|8|100000|You made my sister spit at me
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001425.wav|8|100000|- I expect you to tell the truth.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001426.wav|8|100000|And what is your period, Mr. Smart?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001427.wav|8|100000|Take the room next to hers, Sonja.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001428.wav|8|100000|I've had enough excitement for one life.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001429.wav|8|100000|And poor Mary, she was so scared.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001430.wav|8|100000|- Did you use that as bait so--
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001431.wav|8|100000|I know what dengue fever is like.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001432.wav|8|100000|But break it gently she is old ...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001433.wav|8|100000|We don't make anything off that one.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001434.wav|8|100000|- some manner of harm many moons ago.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001435.wav|8|100000|Hey, o'neill, hand me a bear claw.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001436.wav|8|100000|Is impossible to keep this from Washington
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001451.wav|8|100000|What they do... is they will sit up in this higher energy state... and then drop down again.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001452.wav|8|100000|I slept with Jacob once when I had to go to his house to pick up my dogs.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001453.wav|8|100000|You know, I've been thinking, when you blew up your car back there, you blew up mine, too.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001455.wav|8|100000|I'm just going to go and talk to Daddy for a few minutes... and I'll be right back.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001457.wav|8|100000|I also built that library and used it to help a dozen guys get a high school diploma.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001458.wav|8|100000|No, that is an example of map... I've seen maps, certainly, that have my road on, for example.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001459.wav|8|100000|There are contractors that show up in pickup trucks, and they kind of watch you and surveil you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001472.wav|8|100000|Rest those little bones, while I go out and make a goddamn fool of myself.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001473.wav|8|100000|I can get you an achilles tendon in South Korea for anywhere between $200 and $1,200 dollars.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001474.wav|8|100000|- I could have a thousand years with you, and it would still be too soon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001475.wav|8|100000|What is the reason you were in the desert so close to the Mexican border?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001476.wav|8|100000|Why does everyone feel the need to have these things, these, like, symbols of adulthood?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001477.wav|8|100000|We were supposed to go to Opera House in it and conduct a big raid.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001478.wav|8|100000|I've been keeping it a secret for months, and I'm going to stop hiding it.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001479.wav|8|100000|At the end of the month, I get a bonus, 10% of anything the horses make.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001480.wav|8|100000|The other two were floating in the hotel pool, and they weren't doing the backstroke.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001574.wav|8|100000|I asked her if she would check Alan's cellphone for any recently made calls.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001714.wav|8|100000|I am not making an accusation.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001729.wav|8|100000|He's a man, who kills when he wants to, if I want to, no power on earth can stop me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001753.wav|8|100000|No, it--it--it sounds weird, but it was totally a spur-of-the-moment thing,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001755.wav|8|100000|No, it's just, uh, she caught me at Dad's yesterday, and she really laid into me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001756.wav|8|100000|Very much what everyone...first thing that comes into their mind when they think about me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001757.wav|8|100000|I just spent more and more time at the diner, trying to make the place work.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001758.wav|8|100000|You know, you should check into Mr. Hennessey and see what he was doing last night.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001759.wav|8|100000|I think he hid it in the mineshaft, which is about a half a mile north.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001760.wav|8|100000|Do you know that for a fact, or is that just what you want to believe?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001761.wav|8|100000|Look, Chuck is my boyfriend, and he makes $12 an hour, so you stay away from him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001762.wav|8|100000|Because they definitely want me back, and I wanna be able to have the freedom to...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001763.wav|8|100000|We'll do a second line of resistance up there, on the hill, two hundred meters away.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001772.wav|8|100000|Guys, my back hurts.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001773.wav|8|100000|What is going on?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001774.wav|8|100000|Garza's alibi checks out!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001775.wav|8|100000|No baby, come here.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001779.wav|8|100000|And then I'm frightened.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001863.wav|8|4|I just wanted you to loosen up, have a good time - lt's okay.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001864.wav|8|4|I'm just going to agitate some of your molecules and split them apart.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001865.wav|8|4|None of this would have been possible if you hadn't trusted the Cylon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001866.wav|8|100000|- Fine, once I got 'em six bags of chips and some fresh air.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001867.wav|8|100000|It's sort of the Dukes of Hazzard method of avoiding the cops, so...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001868.wav|8|100000|Because you were talking with Vincent's wife.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001869.wav|8|100000|Do you wanna punish me right now?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001870.wav|8|100000|What are you playing at this time?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001871.wav|8|100000|Forget all this is out here sometimes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001872.wav|8|100000|What did you say your name was?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001873.wav|8|100000|But really, I admire you very much.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001874.wav|8|100000|You made my sister spit at me
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001875.wav|8|100000|- I expect you to tell the truth.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001876.wav|8|100000|And what is your period, Mr. Smart?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001877.wav|8|100000|Take the room next to hers, Sonja.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001878.wav|8|100000|I've had enough excitement for one life.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001879.wav|8|100000|And poor Mary, she was so scared.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001880.wav|8|100000|- Did you use that as bait so--
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001881.wav|8|100000|I know what dengue fever is like.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001882.wav|8|100000|But break it gently she is old ...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001883.wav|8|100000|We don't make anything off that one.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001884.wav|8|100000|- some manner of harm many moons ago.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001902.wav|8|100000|I slept with Jacob once when I had to go to his house to pick up my dogs.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001903.wav|8|100000|You know, I've been thinking, when you blew up your car back there, you blew up mine, too.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001905.wav|8|100000|I'm just going to go and talk to Daddy for a few minutes... and I'll be right back.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001907.wav|8|100000|I also built that library and used it to help a dozen guys get a high school diploma.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001908.wav|8|100000|No, that is an example of map... I've seen maps, certainly, that have my road on, for example.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001909.wav|8|100000|There are contractors that show up in pickup trucks, and they kind of watch you and surveil you.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001922.wav|8|100000|Rest those little bones, while I go out and make a goddamn fool of myself.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001924.wav|8|100000|- I could have a thousand years with you, and it would still be too soon.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001925.wav|8|100000|What is the reason you were in the desert so close to the Mexican border?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001926.wav|8|100000|Why does everyone feel the need to have these things, these, like, symbols of adulthood?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001927.wav|8|100000|We were supposed to go to Opera House in it and conduct a big raid.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001928.wav|8|100000|I've been keeping it a secret for months, and I'm going to stop hiding it.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001929.wav|8|100000|At the end of the month, I get a bonus, 10% of anything the horses make.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001930.wav|8|100000|The other two were floating in the hotel pool, and they weren't doing the backstroke.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001931.wav|8|100000|You know, I should've just done the full nickel the first time you busted me.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001932.wav|8|100000|That guy's got two heads, a foot of reach on us, and no blind spot.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001935.wav|8|100000|The world, you see, though it appears to be expanding infinitely, is truthfully quite small.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001936.wav|8|100000|- Yeah, an adult bear was milked half a dozen times, and then killed for this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001937.wav|8|100000|lot of lost souls took shepherd's call for blood seriously-- family values at its worst.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001938.wav|8|100000|Derek, I'd like to speak with your mom for a moment, is that all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001939.wav|8|100000|I'm Taylor's mother and I was just wondering if you created a fake profile online?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001940.wav|8|100000|Every time Brandon has a blow-up it's, like, always pointed at a stronger woman.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001941.wav|8|100000|So, I told him I'd give him a quick B.J. If he laid off.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001943.wav|8|100000|I object to working on this case on moral grounds.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001947.wav|8|100000|Do me a favor, I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001948.wav|8|100000|I should get my dad a new pair of shoes.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001949.wav|8|100000|Am I gonna have to hear this from you, too?

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001954.wav|8|100000|Why don't we just get it all out in open?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001955.wav|8|100000|- If you don't like me, let's get him someone else.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001956.wav|8|100000|Frank's not a guy that usually comes up with plans.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001957.wav|8|100000|I don't just abandon people when they leave the TARDIS.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001958.wav|8|100000|The Jews, those in the work squads, thought at first...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001959.wav|8|100000|All he done was to recommend Demetrius to the bank.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001960.wav|8|100000|What if Joan and Arthur cave to State and send her home?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001961.wav|8|100000|I think she wants me to rub olive oil on your taint.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001962.wav|8|100000|They were yelling at him, "Mr President, we need you to act!"
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001963.wav|8|100000|Yeah, in the 1920s a cat burglar named Nigel Hubbard left no fingerprints.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001964.wav|8|100000|- My father's had that book in a drawer since I was born.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001965.wav|8|100000|The risk of unpopular decision, competition, corruption, passivity, have prevented any action.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001967.wav|8|100000|If I had a big hollywood guy like you on my team,
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001968.wav|8|100000|I don't think her boyfriend was too happy about her moving out.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001969.wav|8|100000|But this incident has helped me gain a new respect for him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001970.wav|8|100000|Why did you come with a pistol and point it at Tony?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001971.wav|8|100000|I realized I knew Herbert Gelman only after I'd heard his testimony.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001972.wav|8|100000|Meaningless words... you say, as you exhale to slow down the breath.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001973.wav|8|100000|L'm here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001974.wav|8|100000|But, but...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001975.wav|8|100000|Our classmate.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001976.wav|8|100000|- What, Colette?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001977.wav|8|100000|What's wrong?

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001979.wav|8|100000|Let's talk.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001991.wav|8|100000|Do you need ammo, guns?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001992.wav|8|100000|Why are you still here?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001993.wav|8|100000|His bullets untraceable of course.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001994.wav|8|100000|- First, our hosts attacked us.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001995.wav|8|100000|Your hair is so pretty.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001996.wav|8|100000|Shall we arrange this way
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001997.wav|8|100000|Don't lie to me, Logan.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001998.wav|8|100000|I won't show any mercy!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_001999.wav|8|100000|- Not a sound all night.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_002000.wav|8|100000|And you will be crushed.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_002001.wav|8|100000|I've been walking for miles.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_002002.wav|8|100000|Yeah. I'm glad you weren't.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_002003.wav|8|100000|My wedding can suck it?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_002004.wav|8|100000|This isn't the real list.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_002005.wav|8|100000|I'm too fast for TV.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_002006.wav|8|100000|I got these shoes here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_002007.wav|8|100000|The Tysons are here waiting.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_002008.wav|8|100000|- take care of everything else.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_002009.wav|8|100000|Give him a fucking mustache.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_002010.wav|8|100000|That's enough of that horseshit.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_002011.wav|8|100000|- He gave me the explosives.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_002012.wav|8|100000|You're really good at that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_002013.wav|8|100000|What time is that, exactly?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_002024.wav|8|100000|I asked her if she would check Alan's cellphone for any recently made calls.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_002025.wav|8|100000|I'm real glad we have six months together before you have to go to...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_002026.wav|8|100000|What difference does it make if my wife was in on it or not?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_002027.wav|8|100000|I just want to say I'm-I'm so honored that you're-you're doing this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_002029.wav|8|100000|I am falling for you, Caroline, and I'm pretty sure you feel the same.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_002030.wav|8|100000|What it meant to you Was still another chance to move closer to blake.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_002031.wav|8|100000|Let's go to a pet shop tomorrow and get a new cat, all right?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_002032.wav|8|100000|You insisted that you would not be left at Casterly Rock under any circumstances.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_002033.wav|8|100000|I'm really hoping that you and I can move forward with my book, Julianne.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_002034.wav|8|100000|You will call an outsider in the middle of the night and tell him...
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_002035.wav|8|100000|I know you think you're saving your people, but you need to stop this.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_002036.wav|8|100000|You probably aren't the sort of person who is cut out for manipulating others.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_002037.wav|8|100000|The guy hanging naked from the shower curtain rod... half dead from autoerotic asphyxiation?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_002038.wav|8|100000|Well, just don't use no sticks or no knives or no piece of iron.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_002039.wav|8|100000|Because now he'll have to stay with these people for a long, long time.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_002211.wav|8|100000|Look, Chuck is my boyfriend, and he makes $12 an hour, so you stay away from him.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_002212.wav|8|100000|Because they definitely want me back, and I wanna be able to have the freedom to...

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_002222.wav|8|100000|Guys, my back hurts.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_002223.wav|8|100000|What is going on?
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_002224.wav|8|100000|Garza's alibi checks out!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_002225.wav|8|100000|No baby, come here.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_002226.wav|8|100000|Come watch the show.

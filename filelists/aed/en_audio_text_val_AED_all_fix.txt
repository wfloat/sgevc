/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000458.wav|8|1|A passenger went into the restroom half an hour ago, and he's not responding when we knock.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000459.wav|8|1|On the midden log below, Porro also knows and pours his all into a soulful mating call.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000460.wav|8|1|Can't look for bad guys if I have to cut through his gamma breath to see them.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000461.wav|8|1|But if these people knew I was using your Dial-A-Ho service, they might not understand.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000462.wav|8|1|I figured it was an inside job, so I put a nanny cam in the locker room.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000463.wav|8|1|Well, in that case let me raise my glass to the three luckiest men in the room.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000464.wav|8|1|And I can't give it to my silver guy... 'cause he got busted melting' down a menorah.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000466.wav|8|1|Hey, don't you take that sarcastic tone with him!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000467.wav|8|1|Well, turns out it dates back to the 19th century.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000468.wav|8|1|I will know it's like this because of me!
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000469.wav|8|1|Sarah and I will be right by the phone.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000470.wav|8|1|"Well, at least we know where the olive went."
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000471.wav|8|1|I do hope you change your mind about that.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000472.wav|8|1|He left me this weird -- I don't know -- equation.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000474.wav|8|1|No doubt about it the cartel had him whacked.

/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000901.wav|8|2|If the super-hero business ever dries up, he could get a job as a construction worker.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000902.wav|8|2|I was always the guy who kicked the door in, 'cause I was the most aggressive one.
/data/DATA/AED-wavs-22k/0008_000903.wav|8|2|I'm betting he gave me enough power to fast-forward you to the end of your life.
